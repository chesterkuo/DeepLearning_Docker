When I was a kid , I thought , &quot; I think <unk> South America is the best country in the world and I &apos;m often singing the song , &quot; We don &apos;t have to neglect . &quot;
I was so proud of the country .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Captain <unk> <unk> , but not more about the external world , except the United States , Korea and Japan were our enemies .
Although I had wondered how the world was out there , but I still thought I would live my life in <unk> to go until , until all of a sudden , it changed .
When I was seven , I witnessed the people who were taking the public first time in my life , but I still thought my life was completely normal .
My family wasn &apos;t poor , and myself , I had no suffered .
But in 1995 , my mother brought home home a letter from a sister who was in a school with a friend .
In that case , it &apos;s written : When you read these lines , the whole five people &apos; families have no lives over there , because the whole family has nothing to eat in two weeks .
All sides and we were in the floor , and our body is mostly able to feel like death is close .
I was shocked .
Because it &apos;s the first time I know that my fellow is suffering .
Shortly after , when I went through a station , I saw a horror vision that I never could ever forget .
And in the <unk> is a <unk> of a woman who is still holding a <unk> and a baby who knows just staring at her face .
But nobody helped them , because they were having to worry to themselves and family .
In the middle of the 90s , North Korea experienced a severe famine .
It &apos;s more North Koreans who died in hunger , and many people just survive <unk> , deep and primitive trees .
<unk> <unk> occurred , so everything around me was all in the dark , and I was at night , except for the light from the center of China , and the river was just a river .
I was always asked , why they had electricity , we didn &apos;t .
This is a picture from the North Korean satellite in night in the same way that the surrounding countries .
This is the <unk> <unk> , which is the natural border between North Korea and China .
And maybe it can see that the river is very narrow because some North Koreans are <unk> to China .
But many people died .
And I saw that they were all on the river .
I can &apos;t talk about myself , but I &apos;m in North Korea as if it can just tell that in the miserable years of poverty because of that famine I was sent to China to live with a very remote cousins .
I just thought I &apos;d have to be able to get home a short time .
Never even imagined that I would have to be able to get them out of the &apos; 80s .
In China , life &apos;s life was separated from the family as I was very difficult .
I didn &apos;t expect to be able to happen to the life of a refugee who came from North Korea , and what would I find that it wasn &apos;t very difficult , but I realized that it wasn &apos;t very difficult , but was dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea are <unk> .
I always live in a normal fear that my identity would be detected , and I would be paid to be <unk> in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare has made a real job , and I had the Chinese police and brought to the police of the police department .
Someone told them that I was North Korean -- so they tested my Mandarin skills and asked me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , and I felt like my heart was going to blow up .
Because if they saw something unnatural , I would be <unk> and was paid back to the water .
I think my life is <unk> , but I still try to control my emotions and answer their questions .
After the answer , one of the two cops said to the other person , this is a wrong spot .
It &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they sent me out . That &apos;s a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China came to the <unk> of foreign <unk> to <unk> , but many of them were arrested by the police and was paid .
These girls were very lucky .
Because even though it was taken , but finally finally , I was also released by the <unk> of the international community .
But these North Koreans are not very fortunate .
Every year , there are tons of North Koreans who are taken in China and get paid about water , where they &apos;re tortured , incarceration or <unk> .
While I &apos;m very fortunate to be released , there &apos;s a lot of my fellow .
The North Koreans has to cover his identity and struggle for existence in a tragedy .
Even though it was in Chinese and found a job , their life would be <unk> in just a moment .
That &apos;s why after 10 years of <unk> , I decided to take myself to Korea , and I was going to start with a new life .
<unk> lives in this room much longer than I imagined .
Because in Korea , English has a very important position , so I started to learn English , and my third language .
I also realized that the big distance between the South and North Korea .
We are all North Koreans , but we &apos;ve become very different because of the consequences of 67 years split .
I &apos;ve been through my own origins crisis .
I &apos;m South Korea or North Korea ?
Where am I coming from and who am I ?
Suddenly , I had no country to get proudly to call themselves the Army .
Although we also want to adapt to the life of South Korea , it &apos;s not quite easy but I set up a plan .
And starting to learn to prepare for the university .
However , even though I &apos;ve been adopting my life here , I &apos;m told that I &apos;m a terrible news .
The North Koreans found the money that I sent to family , and , to punish my family , and they would have to go to the same area in rural farmers .
They can quickly escape out there , and I started planning to help my family escape .
North Koreans have been <unk> through the gaps that seem to be impossible to reach freedom .
Because the border came from North Korea nearly impossible , so I had to fly to China and then go back to the North Korean border .
Because my family didn &apos;t know Chinese , so I had to go to everyone through 2,000 miles in China and in South Asia .
The bus takes a long week , and once we &apos;ve been to get caught .
Once , our car stopped <unk> and was discovered by the Chinese police .
He got his writings with everybody , and she started to attend .
Because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , so I thought they would be arrested .
When Chinese police came to them , I immediately stood up and said to him that this is <unk> who I was going to have to go .
He looked at me with doubt , but fortunately he believed me .
And we went on to the border of <unk> , and I had to use nearly the entire amount of money that I had to bribe for the <unk> <unk> .
However , after we were crossing the border , my family was arrested for <unk> <unk> .
After I applied a profit and gave a bribe , my family was released in a month , and then again , again in the <unk> .
It was the most courageous moment in my life .
I made enough to get my family to freedom , and I was almost successful , but they were in the same time when we were <unk> Korea , and he was very short .
I went to the middle of the <unk> and the police of the police , desperate to find a way to get married to my family , but I &apos;m not enough to bribe or pay a meal .
I was desperate .
And at the time , there was a man who asked me , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
I was so amazed when a totally foreign person cared about how to do that .
And in English , I told him that , in a dictionary , I told him the following family . No point , that man went to the machine <unk> , and he had to get all the money to the whole family and two North Koreans who were going to get them out to jail .
I &apos;d like to thank him for my heart , and I also asked , &quot; Why do you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t help her , &quot; but he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Koreans . &quot;
I realized that it was a very big moment of meaning in my life .
<unk> from a man who was unusual to be a new hope symbol for me and the North Koreans when we were so needed that , and he showed me the good from strangers and support of the public .
Finally , after a long journey , I and my family was reunited in Korea , but to free , it was just half the struggle of the struggle .
A lot of North Koreans are <unk> with their families , and when they get to another country , they have to start with very few or close to the money .
So we can take a help from the international community for education , train English , teaching English , and many other fields .
We also played a role like the link between people who were in North Korea with the outside world , because there &apos;s lots of people in us who are getting to communicate with other families in the water , and we share them with them and they &apos;re going to be able to change the North Korea and
I was so fortunate to get a lot of help and being inspired during my life , so I wanted to be able to share my country with the country , and I was a chance to develop the same for the country .
I believe that you &apos;ll see more North Koreans who are successful in all over the world , including TED Fellow TED .
Thank you .
I just have a request today .
Please don &apos;t tell me that I normally .
Now I want to introduce you to my brother .
<unk> 22 years old , and beautiful and beautiful .
I don &apos;t tell , but I &apos;m going to make my hope to be the best of any <unk> and no one .
<unk> knows what love is .
I share it in a pointless environment , however , no matter how much .
He didn &apos;t sit in me . He couldn &apos;t differentiate from color .
You don &apos;t care about religion , and let &apos;s understand that , because he never lied .
When you sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember that words come from me , and she can remind me of something that , we know , about how to come , and what we don &apos;t know is to be the way to do that .
Samuel 16 . I was suspicious . He was pretty good-looking .
I had a perfect memory .
But also , there are also selection .
I don &apos;t remember if I had my <unk> <unk> <unk> , but she missed the five of my <unk> on my iPod , and the conversation between us from the four , <unk> his father &apos;s <unk> , and his birthday <unk> , and his <unk> , and my father &apos;s <unk> , and
So are these things that are great ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because of my mind , I don &apos;t fit with the normal social version , and they &apos;re often <unk> and understood .
But what the heart will be more relieved and reassuring and so powerful , although this is true , although they &apos;re not considered normal , it can mean that , by the way , the autistic person and the extraordinary person .
With you not very familiar with the word &quot; autistic word , &quot; it is a brain disorder that affects social communications , learning and sometimes the <unk> .
The symptoms of each other , that &apos;s why <unk> is very different from Sam .
And all over the world , 20 minutes more than a <unk> person , and even though it &apos;s one of the developmental disorders at the fastest , we don &apos;t know the causality or the way we treat it .
And I couldn &apos;t remember the first time I approached the autism , but I couldn &apos;t remember a day without it .
I was three years old when my brother died and I was so excited that there was another one in my life .
And after a couple of months , I realized that I was different .
He yelled at a lot .
I didn &apos;t want to play a lot like the other little kids , and in fact , I &apos;d like to not be interested in anything else .
<unk> and <unk> in your own world , with their own rules , and you see the joy of the most trivial , like the car around the room and stare at a washing machine and eat whatever in your own hand .
When you grow up , you become more different , and the difference is clear .
But the <unk> and <unk> and aggressive and curious and curious is not a really unique thing : pure instinct and naive , a boy who looked at the life without a single <unk> .
Africa used to be used .
Well , I can &apos;t deny that there &apos;s some tough moments in my family , and the moments that I wish you were like are like me .
But I put my memories back to the things that I taught me about the personality , and the lifestyle and my love and I realized that this is what I &apos;m going to not have to do with the normal .
The normal is that the <unk> of the difference for us and what we are different from , doesn &apos;t mean one of us .
It just means that there &apos;s another one .
And if I can just convey something to <unk> and for Sam and for you , that &apos;s you not to have to be very normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because there &apos;s a new autistic degree , and unlike our differences -- we have a gift ! Everyone has to be in a gift , and honestly , chasing the normal is the largest potential .
Opportunity for great greatness , progress and for change that we tried to get as a person .
I don &apos;t mean that I mean .
Thank you .
Maybe you all agree with me this is a nice road .
It &apos;s built from asphalt , and asphalt is a kind of hybrid hybrid kind of material that runs it , but not always , especially not at all today as the sun is <unk> .
Then you can get water on the <unk> .
And especially if you bike , and you go through these cars , it &apos;s not really good .
Also , asphalt plastics also make a lot of noise .
It &apos;s <unk> , if we do the streets of the Netherlands , so close to urban cities , we want a quiet path .
The solution is to do the <unk> of sugar from the nanoscale .
<unk> is the material that we &apos;re now using to build most of the <unk> in the Netherlands , and it smells of <unk> and water <unk> through so that all rainwater can get all the time , and you &apos;ll have a very <unk> path .
And the noise goes through the <unk> .
Because it &apos;s empty , all the noises will disappear , so the road is very quiet .
Of course there are so much , and the <unk> of this kind of <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> bubble can happen .
What the cracks is ? You see that on the street , it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
First of you got a rock , and so much more , and more , more and more , more , more and more , and then -- and there &apos;s not going to do that .
But they can <unk> your car <unk> . So you &apos;re not happy with that .
And after the rest of the world , this whole terrain would fail more .
Sometimes they create the <unk> .
Yeah . He &apos;s ready .
<unk> chicken , of course , can be a problem , but we have a solution .
It &apos;s really like you see this material that has been <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , as I said , you just have a little amount of glue in the <unk> .
Under weather , solar radiation , this <unk> , plastic <unk> , powder of this <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , and if it <unk> , it would have the cracks .
And if you drive to the car , you will destroy these <unk> -- like we just see here .
To solve this , we &apos;ve created the <unk> materials .
If we created this scaffold , we could find the solution .
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and we cut off the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we cut the <unk> into a tiny little piece , and we blend these tiny <unk> .
So we have sugar plastics with tiny steel steel .
Then you need a machine , like you see here , which is a device that uses cooking -- a sensors .
<unk> applications can create , particularly steel , steel hot .
What you do is boiling a steel chip , you do plastic , and plastic <unk> will flow into the <unk> of these <unk> , and the stones that are going to stick to the back of the classroom .
Today I use a <unk> , because I can &apos;t take a sensor from a chance to <unk> on the stage .
<unk> are also the same activity as possible .
I had to sample in the oven , and I &apos;m going to take it out to test how it came .
This is a prototype .
I said we invented a industrial engine , as in the lab , to heat heat heat .
In the lab we tried to spend a lot of samples , and then the government , they actually saw the <unk> and they thought , &quot; Well , it &apos;s very good . We have to try . &quot;
Then they gave us a <unk> road route , 400 meters of <unk> , and we had to build this new material test .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . You watch the test of the test , and then of course this path will survive for many years without harming any <unk> . It &apos;s what we learn from empirical experiments .
We took a lot of samples from this street and we tried them in the lab .
So we &apos;re <unk> the model , and we put them up , and we &apos;re <unk> them with sensors , <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> them .
We can do so much for doing so .
And indeed , the conclusion gave that word from this study , if we were to bully the four years of a <unk> , and this is the size of the <unk> , we built it to protect the real food -- if four years of our <unk> .
Well , to cast , I can tell you that we &apos;ve created a kind of material using a <unk> , add the <unk> , and use heat from the <unk> , to actually help increase the lifespan of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> .
Now you &apos;re probably wondering if it works or not .
We also sample here . It &apos;s quite warm .
It should be cool to give it to a cold , and I just showed you how the product works .
But let me try to see .
Watch the other . Yes , it &apos;s stick .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m here to talk about a question that is very challenging to understand .
The theme is that the secret of violence , and the question I asked is that the question is that everybody always asks : Why is she staying ?
Why should women stay in the audience ?
I &apos;m not a psychopath doctor , not a social technologist or a domestic violence expert .
I &apos;m just a woman who wants to share my story .
And then I was 22 years old , graduated for Harvard College .
I moved to New York City when he was doing the first job writing and editor of <unk> magazine .
The first time I had my apartment , the American Express card , and I had big secrets .
The secret is , this gun is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my head because man &apos;s brother who I thought his grandfather was , since this time .
The man who I loved , everyone <unk> at the head and threats me to death , and I knew that I was not even remembering .
I &apos;m here to tell you about the insane love , a psychological lure that &apos;s secretly <unk> in the <unk> shell of the <unk> , millions of women and even some <unk> .
This can be your story .
I &apos;m not like a family &apos;s <unk> .
I had my English collar Christian , and the marketing administration from the <unk> Business School .
I was so fortunate to work for companies in the top 500 of the U.S. &apos;s children &apos;s Law &amp; amp ; Johnson and Johnson and the Washington Times .
I married the second husband who had 20 years and got together three children .
My dog is the <unk> , and I drove the <unk> <unk> .
So the first thing I want to tell you is domestic violence that happens to everybody every single world , every religion , every single level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I &apos;d like to talk to say is that the family force happens to women , and that &apos;s the problem of women .
Not true .
Over 85 percent of the people who are men , and domestic violence occurs in intimacy , <unk> , talking differently , in the family , where we want to or anticipate that <unk> .
I said myself , I was the other person on Earth , and I was in my life with a man who had beaten himself , but actually , I &apos;m a typical victim .
I &apos;m only 22 years old , in the United States , women from 16 to 24 is the risk of <unk> violence as women in other ages , and in the other 3,000 women , and the women who are <unk> , and the women
I also used to be a typical victim by me , because I don &apos;t know about domestic violence , warning signs .
I met <unk> in a moment , rainy and cold .
He sat in me in the New York City of New York , and he got to me with me .
He told me about two things .
One is he , as I , graduated from school school , and that he worked at a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But the most dramatic thing with me was he was so smart , and he looked like he had a farmer .
He had some of this big , big , glamorous , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;d rather sweet .
One of the smartest things that came out of <unk> did , from beginning to be , to create a illusion that I was a very promising relationship .
He did this in the beginning with a cult .
We started dating , and he loved me to be the same thing that I was smart , that I picked Harvard , that I &apos;m passionate about the <unk> and the job .
He wants to know all about my family and my childhood , and my hopes and dreams and dreams .
Believe me , as a writer and a woman who had no one had ever been .
And he also created the <unk> of belief , and the idea of all of the belief with us , by the way , to admit his secrets , that he &apos;s like a kid from the age of four <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s
And that explains why at <unk> <unk> and the Antarctic Wall and his early Wall Street and his bright future means to be big .
If you tell me that the man is smart , he <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> , and somebody who I am a day at 9 Island , where I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to stay in your eyes , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be in the middle of the <unk> , and I &apos;m
I didn &apos;t know that the first phase of family relations were to temptation and seduction victims .
I also don &apos;t know that the second stage is isolated .
Now , <unk> didn &apos;t go home and say , &quot; Hey , you know , all of Julie <unk> and <unk> , but I need to move to the next stage where I <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , and the other <unk> . &quot;
Instead , <unk> went home to a six and he said to me that he took a sabbatical today of his dream , and he said , he quit because I was so safe , and he was <unk> , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to
Now the last time I wanted to leave the New York and my dream , but I thought you had to sacrifice your life , so I agreed and left , and I left Manhattan .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve been working into a <unk> love , that I &apos;m walking at the very first <unk> of psychological ladder , money and <unk> .
The next thing in this violent violation is to put into violence and see her react .
From here , the gun walks into .
When we moved to New York , you know , where <unk> relies on it , and it &apos;s safe -- he buys three guns .
He kept a tree in the <unk> of our car .
A tree under the knee bed , the third night of our <unk> , he always has us .
And he said he needed these guns because the damage he had experienced in the past was a child .
He needed them to feel protected .
But these gun plants actually are a text for me , and although he hasn &apos;t landed all his arms , but my life in danger is a moment of danger every day .
<unk> had been attacking me for five years before our wedding .
That &apos;s when seven a.m. when I was wearing my pajamas .
I &apos;m <unk> on the roof , trying to amplify the article and I see a lot of anger , and I feel like my anger as the <unk> of the <unk> to the neck and the <unk> I can &apos;t breathe , and I can &apos;t breath , and I can &apos;t breath , and I can &apos;t
In the next year , 10 <unk> in my neck had shown me , and I wore my mom dress , and I ended up with him .
And despite the things that happened , I was still sure that we would live happily because I love him and he loved me so much .
And he was very <unk> .
He was really nervous because his wedding partner and her family .
It &apos;s a personal trial , and he will never hurt me anymore .
It has been there for two times the old moon .
For the first time , I &apos;m driving to find a secret beach and I &apos;m lost , and he &apos;s enrolled in one hand , and I &apos;m very powerful at the end of the car .
And several days later , when he was driving home to the <unk> after a <unk> , he was tired of a car , and he threw the secret of the <unk> to me .
<unk> , <unk> , I put myself up to two times a week for two months and half a year .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and I had a unique thing .
A third of American women experience domestic violence or <unk> <unk> in some of the ages and the CDC suggesting that 15 million children are <unk> every year , 15 million .
So I was in the company very well .
I went back to my question : Why am I staying ?
The answer is very easy .
I don &apos;t know him who are doing all my job .
He even pointed to me , and I push me down to the floor , threatening to kill my dog , and I &apos;m <unk> my car , and I &apos;m driving the car when I &apos;m driving the <unk> to <unk> coffee , and I &apos;m not once thinking to myself , I &apos;m like , I &apos;m a <unk> .
Instead , I &apos;m a strong woman in love with a man who has a problem , and I &apos;m the only person on Earth can help <unk> face his dirty evils .
Another question that everybody asked to ask is , why did she not leave ?
Why did I not step ? I could abandon any time .
For me , it &apos;s the <unk> and <unk> question , because we , the victims know something that you don &apos;t know about : is a terrible danger to leave a <unk> .
Because the last part of the family &apos;s <unk> <unk> is killing her .
Over 70 percent of domestic riots happened after victims that ended up with the relationship , after she left , because then the violence was not going to die .
But the consequence of the same , and even after being used , even after <unk> <unk> ; <unk> from the financial sources and the <unk> of the family &apos;s family to panic , and the children , these kids are <unk> by the judgment of the <unk> .
And we have to ask , why don &apos;t she abandon ?
I could leave , because the ultimate <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I realized that my man loved me , and I would love to kill him if I left him .
So I broke my silence .
I tell people the <unk> , the next-door door , friends and family , all stranger , and I &apos;m standing here because you &apos;re all helping me .
We have the notion of the victims of such as such scary headlines , and women <unk> themselves , and the good things do .
The question , &quot; Why are she staying ? &quot;
The reason for some people , &quot; That &apos;s her fault when he &apos;s going to be a chance of marriage to break us into destruction .
But since the words &quot; <unk> Love &quot; I heard hundreds of stories from men and women who had gone away , who learned that a life of life was from , but what happened , and the people built the life -- happy , the mother , the mother , the mother , life , live , live , live , live
Because the fact that I was a typical criminal victim ended me , I was a typical <unk> of violence .
I married a young man and graduated , and we got together three children .
I had a little widow of the Black <unk> and I had a <unk> .
I never had half , forever , a <unk> in my head , because somebody said he loved me .
Right now , you might be thinking , &quot; Oh , this is great &quot; or , &quot; Oh , she &apos;s <unk> &apos; , &quot; but all this time , I &apos;m really speaking about you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re all listening to me now that I &apos;m saying this is the people who are <unk> or people who are <unk> when the little or <unk> are <unk> themselves .
<unk> can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend at this point .
I can finish my love story by breaking down silence .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this day .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my last request .
Let &apos;s tell you about what you &apos;re all hearing .
The <unk> is just silent .
You have the power to end the simple domestic force by putting in a light .
We need to get all the victims .
We need you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
<unk> the shutter wave of the day by speaking it with your children , your colleagues , your friends and your family .
<unk> their lives as they were happy , but the happy man , lovely .
The earliest idea of violence and lies of conscience , reducing it down , giving a victim to escape .
Together , we can make our sleep <unk> and our family <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special animal .
There are about 10,000 birds in the world .
<unk> is one of the most serious <unk> .
When you see a <unk> <unk> like this , the first thing that &apos;s in your mind is , this is <unk> creatures , ugly , engaged , and just targeted your own politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feeling that you spend for these birds , because they need to be our compassion . They &apos;re really necessary .
I &apos;m going to tell you why .
First of all , why do they have this ?
When Charles Darwin died of the Pacific in <unk> from <unk> , he saw the <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; These birds are disgusting with the bold head that &apos;s created to pick up <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t be a much <unk> , and that &apos;s the words Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed the idea when he came back , and let me tell you why .
They also have been linked to <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , stupid .
More recently , if you &apos;re watching news in Kenya — this is the dominant attributes that binds to the <unk> . But I want to resist that .
I want to resist to resist because you know why ?
Because the landscape doesn &apos;t keep the environment out .
The military doesn &apos;t help prevent disease .
They hardly <unk> a husband .
They were also <unk> .
And what I like to do most is , the <unk> looked more .
There are two kinds of <unk> on the planet .
The New World &apos;s latest <unk> found mainly in the United States , like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> World War , where there &apos;s 16 species . In the 16 species of this . In the 16 species of the <unk> .
So , why is the <unk> important ? First , they provide essential ecological services . They &apos;re wiping out .
They &apos;re actually natural <unk> .
They cleaned up the dead <unk> .
They help lethal bacteria . They help attract with anthrax that may spread and cause huge losses for livestock purposes and cause other animals .
The most recent studies showed that there are areas that have no <unk> <unk> going to be about three to four times more time to biodegrade , and the big consequences from the disease .
<unk> has a tremendous history of importance .
They were connected to ancient Egyptian culture .
<unk> is the symbol of the defenders and mother , and with the snakes , they &apos;re <unk> for the unified agreement in the middle of the <unk> &amp; lt ; Egypt &apos;s <unk> .
In the US spirit , <unk> is <unk> , he took a life on life to save a <unk> death .
In the <unk> culture , they made a very important <unk> , and at the places like <unk> , there is no place to bury dead people , or without wood to burn them , so the <unk> provided a natural <unk> .
So what are the <unk> going ?
We have eight <unk> that appear in Kenya , in which there are six species that are threatened with the risk of extinction .
The reason is that they &apos;re all at the beginning , they &apos;re dominated by the <unk> of the wild <unk> . These communities are using toxins to be in hunting predators but so , the <unk> are <unk> .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four <unk> were listed in the list of risk of risk , which means that they &apos;re less than 10 or 15 years to reach the extinct <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> .
This drug has been banned from the health interest in India .
Because there &apos;s a <unk> , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> of dogs in the area of illegal logging in the animal fields where you have dogs , you have a huge bomb on disease . The number of diseases had a lot of <unk> .
Kenya will have the largest <unk> of the African <unk> in Africa with <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t <unk> the wind , but we need to work with government , because the wind causes these birds to do these birds . They cut it . They cut it .
They are the <unk> .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a <unk> trade trade in the <unk> markets and spells .
So what did we do ? We are doing research on these birds . We &apos;re <unk> the signal .
We &apos;re trying to identify their basic ecology , and in the context that they come .
We can see them moving to lots of different countries , so if you just focus on problems with the scale of the size , this will not help you .
We need to cooperate with the government in the middle of the region .
We are working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about the <unk> of the <unk> of internal <unk> for honor creatures and benefit that they &apos;re offering .
How do you do that ? You can become a dynamic , create voice . You can write letters and tell them that we need to focus on this missing , <unk> , <unk> .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about <unk> , but let &apos;s tell your family , your children , your neighbor &apos;s <unk> .
They were very <unk> . Charles Darwin said he was converting his ideas for his <unk> , and he saw them flying in <unk> , not at the same time .
Kenya , the world , will be much more likely to be in a much more than these other species .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remember a morning I woke up when I was listening to my house .
My father was listening to the BBC in his tiny gray .
He raised a very big smile , and this is unusual because he was very often making him happy .
He goes up : &quot; The Taliban went . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; Now you can actually go to school . &quot; He said .
One morning I can &apos;t forget .
A school is really .
You know , the Taliban were <unk> Afghanistan since I was six and <unk> girls to school .
In five years later , I ate as a son to go with me to a secret school because my sister &apos;s been forbidden by my house .
That &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
Every day , we took another way to the streets without being used to be used to our spots .
We hid the book in the parking section , and everybody thinks we just go shopping .
The school in a house , over 100 children are <unk> in a small living room .
Quite warm in winter , but summer is extremely hot .
We all knew that we were taking our own risk of our own <unk> , and our parents and our parents .
There are some times , suddenly the public school closed a week because the Taliban fungi .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Can we have been tracked ?
Do they know where we are ?
We were so scared , but nevertheless , we wanted to go to school .
I &apos;m very fortunate to teach in a very supportive family of learning and girls .
My grandfather was a very stubborn man at this time .
One totally <unk> guy was rejected from a <unk> in Afghanistan , and he insisted to his daughter , my mother &apos;s mother , and so he &apos;s got his father from giving up .
But the mother had my education teacher as teachers .
She &apos;s here .
She retire 2 years ago to use our house to open her school for girls and women in her neighbors .
And this is my father &apos;s first <unk> who &apos;s been trained .
No doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , regardless of the Taliban , and despite the dangers .
For him , the female doesn &apos;t know that the greater dangers are much more dangerous .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were times when I was angry about our lives and were always terrified and not seen as the future .
I &apos;d like to give away from my school , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , honey , you can lose everything on this .
The money of it can be taken away . You can get permission from the home in the war .
But one thing is forever , and it &apos;s going to be that this thing is in this , and if we &apos;re forced to sell blood to pay money , we &apos;ll do that .
So , what do you want to continue ?
Today I &apos;m 22 years old .
I was raised in a country that was <unk> by the <unk> of the war .
Less than six percent old , I learned after high school , and if my family didn &apos;t commit to my learning students , I became one of them .
But , I &apos;m proud of this -- the graduate student <unk> <unk> .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was <unk> by his family because he dared to go to his daughter &apos;s school , one of the first people who wish to celebrate me .
He wasn &apos;t going to have a <unk> of mine , but I was the first woman , and I was the first woman who could transport him on the streets of Kabul .
I believe my family .
I dreamt , but my family would wish for me .
So I &apos;m the global Ambassador for <unk> , which is the global campaigning for women .
So I made <unk> , the first school and I was only for the daughter in Afghanistan , a country that still <unk> girls to school school .
I &apos;m so excited to see students to my school with expectations to capture this opportunity .
And I saw my parents and their father as my father , support them , regardless and even having a lot of difficulty .
As Ahmed . It &apos;s not his name , and I can &apos;t show him , but fried is my father .
Less than a month , he and his daughter &apos;s on the street to <unk> from their village , and they &apos;re really <unk> killed because of a car bomb in a few minutes .
When he just got to home , phone , a voice voice would threaten him if he proceeds to take her daughter to school , they &apos;ll try again .
He said , &quot; If you want to kill me , but I won &apos;t ruin my future self because the <unk> ideas and the rest of the people &apos; <unk> . &quot;
I now have to see Afghanistan , and this is something that is <unk> in West , is behind most people who are in public <unk> , and the people who are <unk> their own daughters and their people are successful as their own .
This is not a speaker in our success .
In fact , they are the first and <unk> and conservative <unk> of a daughter , but in the context of the society as Afghanistan , we need to support the support of men .
Less than the Taliban , the girls who went to the school for hundreds of people who were not all remembered , and that was illegal .
But today , over three million women are learning in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different from the United States .
I found that Americans see vulnerability , <unk> in change .
I feared that all that changed , and that would not be much longer after the American army .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , when I saw students in my school and their parents supported them , encouraged them , I saw a promising future and changed the course .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , the ability to not limit , and every day of <unk> <unk> reminds me of that .
Like , I like to <unk> .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my cell phone .
A cell cell phones can change your life , and a phone also gives you free personal freedom .
With a cell phone , you can record the image of the <unk> <unk> of the country in Syria .
With a cell phone , you can also upload a <unk> message and start joining a dialogue against the state of Egypt in Egypt .
And also with a telephone station , you can record a song , upload it to <unk> and becomes famous .
All of that is completely possible with your mobile phones .
I &apos;m a young child in 1984 , and I live in Berlin .
Let &apos;s go back to that moment , in this city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and represent change .
It &apos;s in 1989 , and imagine the people who stood up and they would have a phone change on the device .
Who in the cell room have cell phones ?
Please raise it up .
Please raise your phone up , put your name on your phone !
Please raise it up . A Android phone , Clonie , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I &apos;m going to talk about myself and my phone , and about how it has changed my life .
I &apos;m going to talk about that .
There &apos;s about <unk> stream .
<unk> information .
But why do that information come here ?
The reason is due to the summer of 2006 , the European Commission reported a major advantage .
It &apos;s called the data .
Just this one shows every single company in Europe , every Internet service provider in all of Europe , all of the time has to store a huge amount of information about people using the user .
Who is calling who to ? Who sent anybody to email ?
Who sent anybody messages ?
And if you use mobile phones , this is where the problem exists .
All this information is stored at at least six months , until the next two years , you &apos;re using or the Internet provider .
And all around Europe , the people who stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want to have this personal record .
We wanted to have a <unk> of digital age , and we didn &apos;t want that telecommunications companies and the Internet service service provider went all of his information .
They were lawyers , journalists and all the parents , all they said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
And you can see here , like 10,000 people in the street of the Berlin Union , and <unk> <unk> , no fear .
And some people even say , it &apos;s like <unk> 2.0 .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in Eastern Germany .
I also wondered , actually , how did it work ?
Will they stay all of our information ?
When we use our mobile phones ?
So I asked my own family to use , <unk> <unk> , the largest telecom provider in the time , and I asked them , please send me to the whole information that they &apos;ve stored .
I asked them to send me one , and I kept asking , but what I got was just a clear answer . <unk> ironic .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they &apos;re <unk> my life .
And I decided to send a lawsuit to the court , because I &apos;d like to get this information .
But <unk> <unk> said , no , we won &apos;t give you this information .
And finally , I had a <unk> agreement .
I would destroy it , and they would provide me with the information I asked .
Because at that time , the federal donor court , the federal donor , which is the only way the European vehicle is not going to work in the Cultural constitution .
So I received this <unk> <unk> envelope with a CD of a CD .
And on the CDs plate , I &apos;d have to be recorded .
<unk> the information .
The first one I looked at him , and I said , okay . It &apos;s a big data file .
But then I realized , this is all my life .
This is the life in my six months , documenting this whole array of data .
Then I got a little wonder , and what do I do with it ?
Because I can see where I came there , where I slept every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to open up these information .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I &apos;d like to show people the data that &apos;s really really like .
So for <unk> Online and <unk> Data , I also do the same .
These are visual images of life for six months .
You can zoom in or get them , you can also rewind or get back to the front .
You can see the steps that I have .
You can even know I &apos;m going to <unk> by the train to <unk> , and the frequency I call communication between those two places .
All of this can be with this information .
I had a little scared .
But that information isn &apos;t just about me .
It &apos;s information about all of us .
First , it just looked like this , and I called my wife and she called me , and we said to each other , and we talked to each other .
And then some of you call me , they call each other .
And then you call you , and you call you , and you get this huge communication network .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other , when they go to sleep .
You can see all that .
You can see the most momentous parts , like the leaders of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the entire society .
This is a design drawing for countries like China or Iran .
This is a drawing of how to address society by so , because you know who talks to who talk to who , who sent it to the reader , all that would have been if you had access to this information .
And these information are stored at at least six months in Europe , until two years .
As I said when I started , imagine if all of these people on the street of Berlin autumn have 1989 , in the bag of 1989 , in the pocket .
Perhaps perhaps perhaps Anonymous will be going to know who has been involved in this kind of protests , and if you know who is the leader behind it , maybe it will never happen .
The collapse of Berlin <unk> would probably exist .
And so if that , maybe the collapse of the <unk> <unk> in the Cold War would not exist .
Because today , the function and the companies want to <unk> their information , the more information they have , the more we are , and the online .
They want to be able to get in the end of our lives , and because they want to record these information at all times .
<unk> and life in digital age doesn &apos;t work .
What you should do is struggle for your own <unk> today .
And you have to fight it for a day .
Then , when you go home , tell your friends to their friends , is the value of the 21st century , and that doesn &apos;t matter at all .
When you go home , tell you that only one of your representatives , because companies and function bureaucrats can keep around , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to do this .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , please ask the <unk> to provide information that they &apos;ve stored on .
So , in the future , every time you use your phone to remind you that you have to fight for personal autonomy in this age .
Thank you .
Photography &apos;s my passion since I &apos;m big enough to hold a camera , but today I want to share with you 15 pictures that I appreciate most and not taking the best of that .
There &apos;s no art director , no maker , no <unk> , no more than the light .
In fact , most of them are taken by accidental visitors .
The story begins when I arrived in New York City to join in a speech and my wife took a picture of my <unk> birthday in his first birthday . We were in the digital corner and five .
We stumbled across New York City , and then we decided to photograph a little more than that .
You can see where the story is leading .
When my daughter was going to be born for my third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you give you a <unk> to New York doing a tour of your father and daughter , and then continue &quot; wisdom &quot; ?
Since then we started to get visitors through the street .
You know , your camera <unk> of a fully <unk> person &apos;s <unk> is remarkable .
No one refused , and fortunately , there was no one left to our camera .
And that , as we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know how to change our lives .
It became sacred with us .
This is taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened that day in the way that a five-year-old could understand .
These pictures are not just the proxy for a moment , or a particular trip .
They are the way we stop in a week of November , thinking about our time and how we change every year , not only about physical , but about all the circumstances .
Because we took a picture of a photo , but our point of view , my daughter got new points , and I was seen in my eyes , and the way it looked at and interacting with things .
About the time we focused on this is something that we value and expect for all the year .
Recently , in a journey , we &apos;re walking , and my daughter suddenly stops with the middle line , and it just gets the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that he likes to be when he &apos;s a kid in front of us .
She described to me my feeling of her , and she was at the right time .
It said it remembers my heart , and it &apos;s coming out of the cage when it sees that <unk> for the first time , nine years .
And now what it saw in New York is the universities , because it decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized : one of the most important things that we create is memory .
So I &apos;d like to share the idea of acting in a <unk> .
I don &apos;t know how you guys , but in addition to 15 pictures , I don &apos;t show up much more in the family .
I always assumed .
So today I want to encourage all of you to be in this photo , and don &apos;t miss your step into somebody , and ask , &quot; You take a picture of us ? &quot;
Thank you .
I never forget my mom claims -- she passes in exile : &quot; Hey , let &apos;s fight <unk> . Let &apos;s fight him .
But don &apos;t turn to a kind of a kind of <unk> method . &quot;
Nearly two years ago , since the period of <unk> in Libya , was more <unk> due to the <unk> waves of <unk> from the beginning of Tunisia in Tunisia and Egypt .
I joined in forces in and in Libya to call the date of frustration and to start a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s a great revolution .
The young men are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , raising the <unk> of freedom , dignity , justice .
They &apos;ve been very clear to the consequences of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
They showed a <unk> union , and he got a <unk> <unk> , and he got to get up to the south .
Finally , after six months of war riots with total total <unk> to 50,000 people we &apos;ve managed to liberate our country and turn the queen to <unk> .
However , <unk> left a burden , a <unk> of agency , and in the <unk> and divided and divide .
During the decade of the decade , Shell <unk> <unk> destroyed the infrastructure as the same civilization and the moral background of Libya .
The comprehension of <unk> and challenges , I like many other women , <unk> of Libya , to call the civil society , calls the entire comprehensive and moving the transition to the democracy and the national <unk> .
Nearly 200 organizations were set at <unk> during that time and after <unk> fell -- almost 300 at <unk> .
After 33 years of forgiveness , I went back to Libya , and I came back to the <unk> , and I started the training classes , developing the human training .
<unk> women , I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of women who lead every other part of the society , to operate the political rights and peace .
I was in desperate circumstances , and the <unk> of the voters , the more likely to be , is a <unk> environment , and the <unk> of the political view is <unk> .
I led a <unk> of <unk> League of <unk> League of <unk> to behave a comprehensive trade law , which is what can be available , and they &apos;re <unk> , and the most important way to be the other , and the other dimension is to be <unk> .
Finally our invention has been taken and succeeded .
Women win the percentage in Congress in the first <unk> elections in the first couple of years .
However , a little bit of a sense , the Great <unk> of the elections and the revolution revolution -- when every day passes to us waking up with the news .
One day we were waking to the news of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
We were waking up with the American <unk> news , and the American attack hit .
Other days we woke up with the <unk> of soldiers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rules of forces and their communications and their <unk> about human rights as the <unk> of law .
Our societies , in the form by the <unk> mindset , became more <unk> and left the idealistic logic , the principles of freedom , the social values that we followed at the beginning .
The characters , apart from the <unk> and the <unk> of the mind .
I &apos;m here without inspiration for you to give you a story to success in a <unk> form of <unk> and elections .
I &apos;m here to admit that we all -- the whole country has choice , decided to mistake .
We didn &apos;t master the public rights .
Because the elections aren &apos;t carrying peace , stability or security .
Is the list <unk> and <unk> between the candidates and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the country ?
No , no .
So what are the end of that ?
Why do we continue to be a <unk> society , and by the world &apos;s dominant political policies and eliminating , because both sexes and women ?
Perhaps without the right thing about women &apos;s rights but also the educational values of compassion , tolerance , and the entire continent .
Our societies need to need a national conversation and <unk> , and we need to think about the elections , which is just empowering and divided .
Our societies need to have the quality of <unk> that are more from women than the numbers and numbers of women that are truly born .
We need to stop acting like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We need to start acting like the <unk> of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a <unk> conversation that is not only honor but also to practice tolerance instead of hostility , but rather rather than competition , it &apos;s just about stopping .
These are the ideas that have to be necessary that the country has been <unk> to <unk> polio to perhaps harvest peace .
Because peace is like the <unk> , it needs to be <unk> , <unk> among the <unk> and women .
It &apos;s a real lock .
And we need to establish that , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that we do before we do the politics -- societies .
In a sense of &quot; <unk> &quot; -- peace , &quot; is God &apos;s word <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
Next , from &quot; <unk> &quot; was known in the traditional tradition of the <unk> of the origin of the Arabic language , &quot; <unk> &quot; -- <unk> -- <unk> -- the <unk> -- the mother who <unk> the humanity where his men and women , from all the tribes ,
And because the uterus is completely active in developing , the generic matrix of compassion <unk> all life .
So we &apos;re taught that our tolerance is all born .
So we &apos;re taught that our <unk> won &apos;t win a outrage .
May each of us <unk> of tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a little bit like Alice in <unk> .
The King State College asked me , a teacher teaching a communications course to the students .
I &apos;m so scared .
It &apos;s really frightening . Fear students , books are big and all the strange languages .
But when the open exchange started , I experienced what Alice was going to be through when she fell down to the cave and discovered the doors to a new world .
It &apos;s just what I feel when I exchange with students , and I astonished their ideas , and I wanted others to experience this .
I believe the open door to the world is the ability to communicate .
We &apos;re very much a way of communicating to the scientists and engineers to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the most willing to be the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment and the health , and so on , if we don &apos;t know and understand that , what &apos;s not going to be done , and I believe that the responsibility .
But the campaign <unk> can &apos;t happen if scientists and engineers don &apos;t get us to their homes .
<unk> and engineers , eight seconds with us .
I &apos;d like to share some of the deal to do that , and that we realized that we all had the science that was very seductive , very attractive , very attractive , hot .
The first question is : What ?
Why do science do us .
Don &apos;t just tell you that you study bone , but let &apos;s say you &apos;re studying bone tissue , it &apos;s like the grid that causes us to understand <unk> and treatment .
When the science says science , let &apos;s be careful as you use .
<unk> , we know , we understand what he &apos;s thought of .
Sure , maybe it can say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot; But why not use &quot; and <unk> . &quot;
I mean , I think of the idea of being <unk> .
Instead , as <unk> said , the more things that are possible , but don &apos;t just get simpler .
Obviously , he can talk about the science that doesn &apos;t <unk> the idea .
So to the example of the example , telling the story , it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to pull and get us to enjoy what he says .
And when we present , don &apos;t use the lines .
Have you ever wondered why , &quot; The <unk> brick ? &quot;
How about the tiles ? <unk> is a <unk> , killing it , kill it , and they will kill his presentation .
So this one of this , not boring , but it &apos;s also <unk> in the language of the brain , making us get <unk> .
Instead , this slide of <unk> Brown really understood that it &apos;s more than the structure of the bone marrow that it really inspired for original design .
And the trick here is to use simple and easy to read the audience that can rely on that if they &apos;re not shining , and then using the image of the senses to help us understand more deeply than what we &apos;re going to talk to .
I think this is just a few of the surprises that we open up and see the prophet and technology .
I worked with my work I had to teach to know about <unk> <unk> <unk> . So I &apos;d like to summarize with a equation .
Take the &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and shares the <unk> explanation of audiences , then with the &quot; passion &quot; but the word &quot; passion &quot; is the very amazing .
And so , the scientists and engineers , when you &apos;re the kind of talking like this , let &apos;s say eight seconds with me .
Thank you .
Hi . I &apos;m Cameron Russell , and in short time , I &apos;m a model .
Actually , in 10 years .
And I felt that there was an uncomfortable pressure in this room because I should not even wear this blade .
Luckily I had a different suit .
This is the first time who &apos;s the <unk> on TED &apos;s shoulders so I think you &apos;re very lucky to see this .
If some women feel very frightening when I show , you don &apos;t tell me right now , but I &apos;ll get through Twitter .
I realized that I was very lucky to change what you think about me in a short 10 seconds .
Not everybody has a chance to do this .
These high heels are uncomfortable , and I &apos;m not going to bring them .
The worst is the <unk> of this long <unk> , because you &apos;re smiling , so don &apos;t do anything at the top of me .
All right .
Why do I do that ?
It &apos;s a odd thing .
Actually , hopefully it doesn &apos;t work as if this image .
The image has a very powerful power , but it &apos;s also fake .
I just changed what you think about me in six seconds .
And in this photo , I had no son in my life .
I felt very uncomfortable at the time , and photographer told me Jesus <unk> <unk> and put his hand on his hair .
And of course , unless the surgery , or the <unk> of <unk> , I had two days ago to photograph , had very few things that we could do to change the appearance of our appearance , and we were not going to be able to change it , and it was a very large
So today , with me , no fear of being true .
And I stood on this stage because I was a model .
I stood on this stage because I was beautiful , a white woman , and in the model of the model , we called that <unk> .
And I would answer the questions that everybody was always asking me , but with true realities .
The first question is , how do I become the model ?
And I always said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m discovered , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I actually became a model because I won the cloud , and I &apos;m an innovator who received property property , and maybe you might be wondering what the legacy of discovery is .
In the past decade , we have to redefine beauty , not just healthy , and the <unk> that we &apos;re programmed to be <unk> to desire , but the height , the <unk> and the <unk> .
This is the legacy that made me and that &apos;s the legacy I made for it .
I knew there was some of you who were skeptical of this , and maybe some of the people ate a nice food model like , &quot; Wait . Naomi <unk> . Joan <unk> . &quot; Andrew <unk> . &quot;
I want to praise the idea of your <unk> . It &apos;s very impressive .
But unfortunately I had to tell you five 2007 years , a Ph.D. in New York Times &apos;s <unk> , and in <unk> people who are hired that only 27 people , less than four percent , are not white .
The next question that everybody always asked me is , &quot; Can you be the models when you &apos;re big ? &quot;
And my first answer is , &quot; You don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have to employ recruiting . &quot;
But the next answer I really want to tell those girls is : &quot; Why ? &quot;
You know ? You can be anyone .
You can become the United States , or the inventor of the Internet , or a cardiologist &apos; heart of a cardiologist , would be great , because I &apos;m going to be the first .
If , after that interesting list , they still say , &quot; No , no , no , no , you want to be a <unk> , and I would like to be a <unk> . &quot;
Because she had no power , and I could be the editor of the <unk> magazine in the United States or the director of H &amp; amp ; D , or Steven <unk> .
Tell me that I want to be the person when you grow up like you like to win the lottery when you grow up .
It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career .
I &apos;m going to prove to you -- with 10 years of experience I &apos;ve accumulated , because it &apos;s not like the heart surgeon , so just a short time .
If photographer standing here , it &apos;s up there , like a nice interaction , and as a customer says , &quot; Cameron We want to shoot a picture of you , and then you can just go to the retreat , and then you can just go to the retreat , and then you can just go to the retreat , and then you can just go to the retreat , and then you can just
Like this .
Hope is less rare than the picture .
I don &apos;t know what happens at the time .
Sadly , after you finished , you write <unk> and used to make some work , you can &apos;t talk more about it , because if you want to be president , but your <unk> says : &quot; The <unk> : 10 years of &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
The next question that people ask me : &quot; Is there all images that are made right ? &quot;
Yeah , it &apos;s almost like all the images that are <unk> , but that &apos;s just a little element of what &apos;s going on .
This is one of the first photos that I took , and I was the first time I took a furniture photograph , and I was not even a walking cycle .
I knew that we were going to go into personal objectives , but I was a young girl .
This is my appearance , my father &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s a couple of months earlier .
This is me in the same day when I photograph a picture .
My friend &apos;s friends went to me .
This is me on the bedroom days before I photograph <unk> French .
This is me with soccer teams in <unk> magazine .
And here I am .
I hope you look at -- images are not my image .
These are the images that are built , and it &apos;s built by a group of experts , and <unk> , <unk> , photographer , photographer and innovators and all assistants , and they create this .
The next question I &apos;m doing is , &quot; What are you for free ? &quot;
I have a lot of <unk> pair of <unk> , which I never wear , but the free thing that I get is what I &apos;ve been doing in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I was in the store , and I had forgotten to bring money and they gave me free and free one t-shirt .
When I was a teenager , I sat a car with her friend , and she was a very scary driver , and she had a <unk> , and we got <unk> , and all I did was , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; and we can go .
I got that free , and I was in my appearance , not because I am somebody and have people ready to spend a lot of money on their appearance rather than because they are .
I live in New York , and last year , in 140 million juvenile teens and <unk> , 86 percent is black and <unk> , mostly young teenagers .
In New York , there are only 8,000 black people and <unk> , so for them , the question is not , &quot; Am I arrested ? &quot;
And what is that &quot; I &apos;m going to get arrested and when ? &quot;
When I was preparing to talk to this talk , I discovered that &apos; 95 percent old girls in the United States didn &apos;t like his body , and this number up to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The final question that people ask me is , &quot; What are the touch of the person ? &quot;
I think what they want to hear is &quot; If you lean a little bit cheaper , and your hair <unk> , you &apos;re happy and happy . &quot;
And when we were behind the wings , we gave the answer .
&quot; It &apos;s great to travel , and working with creative people , inspired and enthusiasm . &quot;
And those are the truth , but that &apos;s just half , because what we never say before the lens , what I never told you before .
I &apos;m insecure because I had to think about my image every day .
And you have to ask yourself , &quot; Who is your <unk> narrower and hair <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be happier ? &quot;
You just have a group of people who sample , because they have the <unk> legs , the most peaceful hair , and in the most beautiful toy , and they can be the most insecure women on the planet .
When I wrote this speech , I felt very hard to find a real balance , because one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to say , &quot; I have all this stuff because I &apos;m lucky , &quot; and it &apos;s not going to be me happy . &quot;
But mostly , it &apos;s hard to flip a computer and a bond where I &apos;m one of the most powerful .
But I &apos;m also happy and the honor to be here , and I think it &apos;s luck , and I &apos;ve been to the front of 10 , 20 or 30 years of the year and I &apos;ve been working with a lot of the companies in my life , because then I can &apos;t tell the story to do , and I can &apos;t tell the story to do , and I can &apos;t tell the story .
If there &apos;s something that is stuck in this talk , I hope it &apos;s all about us all comfortable being comfortable when we recognize the power of the image and our failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that people in all around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t touch each other around , so there &apos;s a lot of intelligence that has never known , whether we share public spaces .
So a couple of years ago , I was trying to get more ways to share more of my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paper glue , cheating and fun .
And these projects came from the question of the question , as I was , and my neighbor &apos;s father &apos;s neighborhood to get to their houses ?
How do we borrow and borrow a lot more than we can <unk> the houses of each other at worst time ?
How do we share more of our memories about these <unk> buildings , and we know better to understand what we are ?
And how do we share more of our hope for the rest of our lives , like ours can reflect the need and dream today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I &apos;m in my love .
I was always fixed by the <unk> <unk> trees , and they had <unk> shadows , and they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> years ago , and I believed in the city that always seemed to be the same .
I felt like every time that he <unk> , New Orleans has a march .
Cities have the most beautiful architectural buildings in the world , but it also has some of the largest <unk> values in the United States .
I lived close to this house , and I thought , how I could do it as a better place for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that could change my life forever .
In 2009 , I took a man who was very passionate .
Her name is Joan , and she &apos;s a mother for me , and her death is amazing and unexpected .
And I thought about death , and this made me feel deep to thank the moment for the time , and brought clarity to the implications of my life now .
But I struggled to keep this angle of life in my daily life .
I feel like that &apos;s easy to capture , and I can get away from the fact that there is really meaning to you .
So with the help of the old friends and new , I moved on this <unk> of abandoned buildings into a giant <unk> bottle and <unk> with a <unk> sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; to not let any of you go through a <unk> , and they can just take their personal lives , and
I don &apos;t know what to look for from this experiment , but on the next day , the wall has been covered completely sealed , and it keeps growing .
And I want to share some of the things that people write on that wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to try to rob a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be mentally left the way in the U.S. Foreign Revolution . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to grow a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live outside . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be held her again . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be somebody . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this space was <unk> , and this was a knowledge bias , and the hope and everyone &apos;s dreams made me laugh , diarrhea , and they were free for hard times .
That &apos;s about knowing that you don &apos;t just have one .
It &apos;s about understanding people around us and <unk> .
It &apos;s about creating space for the reflection and contemplate , and remember what really means that it really means that we &apos;re growing and change .
I &apos;m doing this last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from the heat of the people who wanted to do a wall in their community , so the central Democratic teams and I made a tool , and now the walls were now being done in the world .
Together , we &apos;ve shown our public spaces that have the power to get that if we &apos;re given to the opportunity to have a voice and share more with another person .
The most important things we have is time and relationship with others .
In the age of our extensive distribution , this is more important than ever to find a way to maintain and remember that life is short and soft .
The death is something that we usually don &apos;t have to be properly encouraging or even thinking about , but I &apos;m aware that preparing for death is one of the most powerful power you can do .
Think about life being so obvious .
Our spaces are probably more likely to be able to get more than reflected on what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and more ways to share hope , they can help us to make better things , they can help us to help us .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I made a math algorithm and this is a very unusual problem for anyone who mathematics mathematics , which is that we like <unk> consultants .
Nobody knew what we did .
So today I &apos;m going to try to explain to you what I do .
Well , dancing is one of the activities that human beings do .
We love the master Age of three <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;ll see this .
<unk> <unk> requires a special degree of expertise and advanced engineering and maybe the size of the <unk> of this puzzle relevant .
Sadly , nervous disorder slows down this particular possibility , like what happens to me <unk> <unk> , who once once once once a <unk> artist .
Over the past few years had had tremendous progress in the treatment .
However , <unk> million people worldwide have disease , and they have to live in debilitating condition , shake <unk> , <unk> and other symptoms that are accompanied by this disease . What we need to be the tools to find a better disease , and then we need to
We need to measure progress as a way , and ultimately , the only way that we know that we actually have a treatment , is that when we have a proper approach to make sure .
But it &apos;s <unk> to the Parkinson &apos;s disease and other sexual <unk> , they don &apos;t have a very <unk> parasite , so no simple blood test you can do , and the best thing we have is this <unk> .
You need to get to the hospital to do that . It &apos;s very expensive , which means that this test is outside of clinical trials , it never has done it .
But if the patient can do this at home ?
That will be a free trip to the clinic , and if the patient can also be able to test again , what ?
No time at the time of the prime .
Just about $ 300 , to test this experiment in the professional Medical Medical departments .
So what I &apos;d like to suggest to you is a traditional way of which we can achieve this , because you see , at least one direction , we are all masters like <unk> <unk> you .
Here we have a video of the <unk> .
And this is a very healthy second , and somebody is saying , and we can see ourselves as the <unk> dancer <unk> , because we have to coordinate all the <unk> agencies when we create sound , and we can actually have genes to do that .
Like , like three <unk> it requires to be <unk> .
I mean , try to lose a child for a kid .
From sound , we can actually be able to track the <unk> <unk> , when the images of Parkinson &apos;s <unk> , the negative organs are also <unk> .
So in the bottom graph , you can see an example of the <unk> <unk> .
We see all the same .
We see the <unk> , the debilitating and <unk> .
The word gets more <unk> and more accents than a while , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
These <unk> effects can really predict , in some cases , but with any digital technology , and using the speech framework that <unk> the <unk> , which is really , we can actually <unk> the right people , and they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> .
So how do you do this based on this voice based on this <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> clinical trial ? All right .
The experience of neuroscience has no <unk> . They &apos;re using infrastructure .
You don &apos;t need to design a whole new hospital system to try to run this experiment .
And both the <unk> . But one , experimented with the voice is not technical .
That means that it can be done .
Fast speed , just about 30 seconds .
<unk> cost , and we all know what happens .
When something is <unk> , it &apos;s going to be widespread .
So this is a great number of <unk> I think we can do now .
We can <unk> to the patient .
Needless to go to the clinic to check .
We can do the observations that are high to the frequency of the high data to get data down .
We can actually do a <unk> of a <unk> , so low cost to try to test clinical trials , and appeal to the number of civilian population is possible for this .
We had opportunities to start seeking to find the original ecological footprint before it was too late .
So , to do the first steps that went to this , we were putting the first <unk> opening up for example .
With <unk> and <unk> , we aim at record sounds with some enormous quantities globally , to gather enough data and start to behave in four .
We have local inhabitants who can access to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who healthy or Parkinson &apos;s disease might call it to low cost , and leave it with tape , some cents per impulse , and I &apos;m happy to announce that we &apos;ve been six percent .
Thank you .
Tom <unk> : So Max , by taking all of the sample &apos;s pieces of <unk> , you can tell who healthy and who doesn &apos;t ?
What are you going to conclude from these patterns ?
Max <unk> : Yeah . Okay . It &apos;s going to happen , when you &apos;re calling you something , you have to be aware of your disease .
You see , some people can &apos;t do that . They can &apos;t call .
But we &apos;ll take a huge amount of data that collects all the data collected all the different cases , and the result is in different ways , and we &apos;re going to be very important , because then we look at the <unk> factors of this disease .
So the exact time is 86 percent ?
More than that .
In fact , my students <unk> , I had to praise him , because he made some amazing jobs , he showed that it could also be able to do the phone , and that allowed this project to be done , and the exact same precision to the 99 percent .
<unk> . Yes , a <unk> improvement .
So , that means that people will be able to be able to call their mobile phones and do this test , and the people who have Parkinson &apos;s disease might call , listen , the voice , and then the doctor can check , and then the
Exactly .
Thank you very much . <unk> <unk> &apos;s Max .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I live in the Central areas .
This is the south area : the wine store , the fast food , the unknown .
So the city planners go together and they &apos;re going to be the Middle East , and so they make it more meaningful , so they transform the city into Southern Los Angeles , like that would be able to solve the problems that are really happening in the city .
This is the Asian South Angeles .
<unk> , junk food , <unk> .
Like <unk> million Americans , I live in a <unk> desert desert in Los Angeles , the kitchen <unk> of the fast food suit and <unk> .
The interesting thing is that the fast food of the sugar is killing more people than they are <unk> .
In the Los Angeles city , people were dying for diseases that were curable .
For example , the obesity rate in my area is five times more than Beverly Hills , for instance , somewhere about 16 kilometers .
I &apos;m tired of trying to witness this .
And I wondered how to do it without food , when every time you came out of your door to see the bad impacts that the food system was now caused for us living ?
I saw the wheelchair sold as the old car .
I see the <unk> centers growing up like Starbucks .
And I realized that it had to end .
I realized that the main problem is the solution .
The food is a problem and food is also the solution .
And I felt so tired to drive a million minutes just to buy a apples that are not contaminated by me .
What I did was I was planting a <unk> in front of a <unk> .
It &apos;s on a piece of land that we call a pedestrian path .
It &apos;s more than 700,000 , <unk> .
The problem is , the land is about the city .
But you have to keep it .
So I thought , &quot; Great . I can do what I want , because that &apos;s my responsibility and I have to keep it . &quot;
And this is how I look at that land .
I &apos;m with my team , the green land , and we gather together and we start to plant the food jungle : fruit fruit , you know , both the <unk> vegetables .
We are a group of people share <unk> , and we are <unk> of <unk> from many different lives , from every place in the city , and they &apos;re completely voluntary , and everything we do is , we &apos;re all free .
And the piece of the garden , it &apos;s beautiful .
Then there &apos;s the <unk> .
I came to see , to see , and I was like , and I was giving me a text , and I asked to break the garden . And that &apos;s the way I was going to be <unk> .
And I like , &quot; Come on , really ? &quot;
A <unk> for planting trees in the soil where the people who didn &apos;t care ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . Take it . &quot;
So this time doesn &apos;t come .
And the New York Times got news , Steve <unk> wrote a paper about it , and discussing with Professor <unk> . And one of the members of green lands sent a petition to a petition company and with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a victory in our hands .
The council for the council the council , it would also be called and said , they &apos;re giving and they &apos;re like that we &apos;re doing .
I mean , okay , why not ?
Police takes the United States of the land , which has the city of the <unk> .
They owned 42 square kilometers of abandoned land .
It &apos;s equivalent to 20 public parks .
They &apos;re enough to grow <unk> million tomato flowers .
How do they disagree ?
Palm charcoal is a <unk> plant , 10,000 pounds more .
When the green bean costs a dollar to give you the equivalent of the <unk> of the 75 dollars .
It &apos;s my faith , when I tell people , let &apos;s make a job attack .
<unk> food is also the same for the print .
I had legacy in the South Central .
I grew up there . I taught my son to be there .
And I refused to make a part of the reality that made this , which is made for me , and I &apos;m creating a real job .
I &apos;m a artist .
Making a garden is my art . I grow my work .
Just like an artist , the <unk> for the wall , I &apos;m in the point of <unk> , walking a walk .
I use the garden , the land as a canvas , and plant trees and green trees are what I &apos;m in the moment .
You &apos;re probably surprisingly surprised to do that if you make them into canvas .
You can &apos;t imagine how the <unk> sunflower is , and they affect people who are .
So what happened ?
I witnessed my garden to become a training tool , a tool for the transformed zones of my reservation .
To change the community , you have to change the part of the land .
We are the land .
You &apos;re surprised to see how the kids are affected .
Making the world be the most valuable thing and the most challenging , you can do it , especially in interior buildings .
So , you get a strawberries .
I remember one , a mother and daughter got , at the time , 10 p.m. and they were in the <unk> garden , and I went out and they were embarrassed .
I think , oh , I feel so bad because they &apos;re there , and I tell them , there &apos;s no need to do that .
This piece of gardens is on the road , which is the reason it &apos;s .
I felt ashamed to see someone who was close to me , and I still got hungry , and that was just more enhanced to do , and I was going to make it wrong , and everyone asked me : &quot; What are you going to steal ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Of course not , I &apos;m not scared of them to steal .
So they &apos;re on the street .
The whole idea is that .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to get their health . &quot;
And there was another time when I made the garden in a <unk> in the Los Angeles .
There are men , they help me to take me from the truck .
<unk> , very happily , and they share stories about <unk> , and they &apos;ve been growing them with them and they &apos;ve grown with their mother , and she &apos;s been growing up , and it &apos;s great to see this idea , whether it &apos;s just a minute .
So the green soil has continued to grow about 20 <unk> .
We had about 50 people who went to participate , and they were all voluntary .
If they grow <unk> , they &apos;ll be able to fix it .
If they grow tomato sauce , they eat their tomato flowers .
But if no one can show that it &apos;s not seen the effect of food to your mind and the body , blind blind , they &apos;re blind .
I see young people who want to be done , but they &apos;re <unk> something -- I see the full children and they just walk in the road , but not where .
With the garden , I see a chance that we can guide them to the populations of their communities , and there is a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we &apos;re going to produce George Washington <unk> next .
But if we don &apos;t change the part of the land , we &apos;ll never be able to do that .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to grow a piece of glass that &apos;s in there , and everybody can share food .
I want to take the <unk> and make them <unk> , and make it <unk> .
Don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about the free stuff , because free free is not sustainable .
The interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
I &apos;m talking about the work that &apos;s giving people , and pull them out of the street , and tell them to be happy , and it &apos;s pride and joy and joy and other people &apos;s risk to grow .
What I want to do here , we &apos;ll make it really sexy .
I want all of us to be <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We will change the concept of <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have to be a garden , you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
Do it to do that with your <unk> , okay ?
And let &apos;s turn it into weapons .
Basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to see , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and join the meeting where you talk about doing this , and you talk about doing this .
If you want to meet me , let &apos;s go with your <unk> and you will grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , the northern National <unk> .
And behind me , my <unk> , and behind the <unk> , is the Canadian <unk> Park .
The National <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not geographically geographically geographically geographically geographically geographically available in the South to the south , which means that wildlife animals appear out of a free way .
And so the animals like lions are behind them , and this is what lions do .
They kill our cattle .
This is one of the <unk> that were killed at night , and when I woke up in the morning , I found it dead , and I felt very sad because that was the only male that we had .
My community , the <unk> , believed that we went from heaven with all of our animals and all the land to keep them , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re very careful that we &apos;re very careful to
So I grew up with the <unk> .
The <unk> of the community were <unk> us and livestock and so seriously .
So they killed lions .
This is one of the six lions that are killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why lions in the city of Nairobi are very small .
Each son from six to nine years old , in my community , was responsible for my father , and I also had to do the same .
So I had to find a way to solve this .
The first idea I had was using fire , because I thought lions were scared .
But then I realized that fire doesn &apos;t really work , because it even helped lion see the <unk> .
But I quit . I kept thinking .
And my second idea is to use the interrogation .
I tried to fool those lions &#91; in the &#93; thinking of the following thought I stood near the <unk> .
But lions are very clever .
They &apos;re going to the first day and see the <unk> , and then they go back , but they &apos;re going to go and say that this doesn &apos;t move , it always is there .
And then lions jump and kill animals .
So in one night , I grabbed a torch from the <unk> , and that morning , lions are not coming .
I discovered that lions fear the light .
So I had a idea .
Since the kid , I &apos;ve worked in my room all day , and I even opened the radio up of mother &apos;s mother , and she was at that day , and I had a lot of stuff about electricity .
So I took a <unk> car , a <unk> , a meter of a meter that found out in the car and it helped drive the driver to make a <unk> , and right . It flashes .
And I got a switch to make a switch and open the lights .
And that &apos;s a little light from the <unk> hybrid .
And I put everything .
As you can see , the solar cell uses to whip , and you can provide energy for the clock . I call it the <unk> .
And the clock watches the light <unk> .
As you can see , the lights are out there , because that &apos;s the rocket &apos;s approach .
And that &apos;s how the lighting &apos;s on the lion when they &apos;re in the late night .
The lights were <unk> and <unk> them to make them think that I was walking around the <unk> , but actually I was sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
I installed it in my house two years ago , and since we don &apos;t have any problems with lions .
<unk> families tell about this idea .
One of them is this .
She had a lot of cattle who killed lions killed , and she asked me if I could help her build the shadows .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the shadows . You can see in the back , they &apos;re the <unk> .
So far , I &apos;ve helped them to put seven families in my community , and they &apos;re working .
Now my idea is that I &apos;ve been used throughout all over the Kenya to <unk> other animals like hyenas , and they say , and it also used to threaten the herd of farmers &apos; farmers &apos; population .
Because of this invention , I &apos;ve been lucky enough to get in one of the best schools in Kenya , China , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school is starting to help with a donation and raise awareness .
I also led my friends to my colleagues , and we put the lights for the families who were not access to it and I taught them how to build them .
A year ago , I was just a little boy in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I saw flying planes , and I said to myself that one day , I would be sitting inside .
And I &apos;m here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with the first airplane to join TED .
My biggest dream is to be a flying engineer and pilots and enterprise .
I had hated lions , but now because my invention is saving the <unk> of the day and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . According to my language , it means thanks to a lot .
I don &apos;t know what that &apos;s really interesting to hear about your story .
So I had this scholarship . Yes .
I &apos;m doing other things .
What do you invent in your list ?
Is your invention of your own , and I want to make a wire barrier . <unk> <unk> ?
I know that the <unk> has been invented , but you want to do my own .
She tried , right , and I &apos;m not -- I tried to put it before , but I stopped <unk> .
Richard <unk> , I &apos;m different .
We &apos;ll be able to dance on the road , you &apos;re walking .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I did , and what I did , and what I did -- <unk> , <unk> , was <unk> in the seven years of work in Africa .
Since <unk> to <unk> , I &apos;m young , and I &apos;m not so sure -- I &apos;ve worked in Zambia , Kenya , <unk> Coast Coast , Algeria , Somalia , Somalia .
I worked for the government &apos;s NGOs and each project we built in Africa .
I <unk> my brain .
The 21 years , I think , the Italian and we &apos;re doing good at Africa .
But instead of that , we killed everything that we touched .
The first project , which inspired my first book , &quot; <unk> bubbles , &quot; is a project in which people decided to <unk> food .
So we were <unk> with the seeds from the Italy in the <unk> , <unk> valley , and we taught the people to <unk> the <unk> of the orange world and ...
Of course the local community doesn &apos;t interest this at all , so we paid them , and sometimes they were to work .
We really wonder about the locals , in the <unk> Valley , and there &apos;s no breeding .
But instead of asking them to plant anything , we simply say , &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot;
&quot; Just keep it <unk> to save the <unk> . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa are very well .
We have great tomato sauce . In Italy , a tomato one is only about this size . In Zambia , it &apos;s larger than this .
It &apos;s hard to believe , and we tell the people who are <unk> , &quot; Everybody who &apos;s going to have to grow this license . &quot;
When the tomato sauce started to reach , nine , and there were red , just through a single night , about 200 galaxies from <unk> to <unk> and <unk> all .
We told the elders , &quot; Oh my god , the <unk> . &quot;
And the people who said , &quot; Yes , it &apos;s why we don &apos;t grow in the air . &quot;
&quot; Why people don &apos;t tell us before ? &quot; &quot; You have to ask . &quot;
I thought there was a <unk> of people in Africa , but after I looked at what Americans are doing , British people are doing , the French are doing , and after the witnesses , I feel that it &apos;s all about the
Because , you see , that &apos;s only one of us we eat .
You should look at what &apos;s <unk> , you should look at the crap that we &apos;ve given to Africans poorly .
You want to read a book , read , &quot; The <unk> <unk> , &quot; wrote by <unk> <unk> , who is a Lebanese economist .
The book was released in 2009 .
We , the Western aid nations brought the African continent , and the North States of <unk> <unk> in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that it has already been caused .
Look at her book .
Reading it from a African woman , the damage that we &apos;ve made .
The Western <unk> as we are <unk> , and the human missionary , and we only have two ways to treat others : or help or security or security .
Two words from La <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which means &quot; to dad . &quot;
They bring two different meaning .
And I said , &quot; I treat anybody from another culture as if they are my child . &quot; I love them . &quot;
I &apos;m treating all of you from other cultures as I am .
That &apos;s why people white people in Africa are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; he .
I &apos;m like to be a <unk> in my face , and I read , &quot; <unk> , &quot; but beauty , &quot; wrote , &quot; wrote , and all , above all , in the economic development , if others don &apos;t need help , let alone .
So this should be the first commandment on aid .
The first commandment on aid is respect .
Now the organizers of this meeting put a <unk> up a floor , and said , &quot; Can we all -- Have you <unk> about a city without new people ? &quot;
When 27 years old , I decided to only respond to people and I created a system called <unk> <unk> , where you wouldn &apos;t start to any kind of motivated , but became a person who would enjoy the <unk> , and I was the proud to the local .
So you do <unk> .
Don &apos;t bring a community with ideas , you sit with the locals .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We met in coffee . We were <unk> .
We don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
And what we do is , you &apos;re the friends of the world , and find that what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is that .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , then you have to do what you do ?
The human aspiration has to give to the development of the self as the most important .
The men &apos;s aspiration to the rise of personal growth is the most important thing .
And we helped them to explore the understanding , because no one in the world can succeed .
The idea has no idea that there &apos;s a knowledge , but it &apos;s always the understanding .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , just one , instead of , to a community , and tell people that they should be doing , why don &apos;t we listen to them , but not in public meetings , but not in the public meetings , but not in
Let me tell you a secret .
There &apos;s a problem in meetings .
Companies aren &apos;t coming to the next day , and they don &apos;t have to tell you , in the community meetings , they want to do with your money , the opportunity that they find .
So planning has this kind of blindness .
The smartest people in your community , you never know because they &apos;re not going to go to public meetings .
What we do is work , and to do that , you have to create a kind of a social structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new professional .
A new professional , as a family doctor for business , doctor gives jobs to work , and in a diner , at the kitchen , at the coffee shop , and help you find resources to make your desire to make your desire to make your desire to make your desire to create your desire to create your desire to create a
I started like an experiment in <unk> , Western Australia .
I &apos;m in the Ph.D. School of philosophy at that moment , trying to avoid away from that <unk> , which is to come and tell you what to do .
So what do I do in the first year in <unk> is just a <unk> , and in three days , a <unk> man in a van , called <unk> , and I help him to a restaurant at <unk> , and then he can help me to do a
And I help these fish who know how to work together and sell these <unk> tuna that are not a box projector factory at <unk> with 60 dollars , but we find a way to sell them to the <unk> to the $ 15 to a boss , and then the farmers who are
In a year , I had 27 consecutive projects and the government of the government to ask me , &quot; How do you do so ?
He did this ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I &apos;ve done a very hard job .
I shut down , and listened to them . &quot;
So , the government says to me , &quot; You can do it . &quot;
We did that in 300 communities around the world .
We helped the <unk> work .
There &apos;s a new generation of entrepreneurs who are very overweight for isolation .
Peter <unk> , one of the greatest management consultants in history , through 96 years old , a couple of years ago .
Peter <unk> is a professor of philosophy before working to work with business , and this is what Peter <unk> says : &quot; <unk> <unk> , not merely incompatible with a society and a business economy . &quot;
<unk> is a death kiss for the businessman .
So now you &apos;re replicating that the most wise people in <unk> want to do what &apos;s the world &apos;s money .
You have to learn how to make these people go to talk to you .
You have to give them to the privacy , private , you &apos;re really excited to help them , and they &apos;ll go , in the crowd where they &apos;re going .
With a thousand people , we can have 200 clients .
Could it be able to imagine an al 400,000 community , brilliant entertainment and aspiration ?
What do you talk about your <unk> in the morning ?
The indigenous people , the hungry , are the <unk> .
So what I &apos;m talking about is the neuroscience of it .
We are at the final stages of the <unk> Industrial Revolution with the fuel of the <unk> of R &amp; amp ; Poor buildings , and the breakthrough , we have the systems that are unsustainable .
The engine of <unk> in unsustainable .
The <unk> approach to store things is unsustainable .
What we have to look at is that we do how to nurture , treatment , education , communication and communication for seven billion more sustainable people .
No technology does that .
What would it be invented to invent a technology for the green revolution ?
The government ? Forget !
It will be the identities , and they &apos;re doing that right now .
There &apos;s a very fun story that I read on a journal magazine for years .
There &apos;s a group who invited experts to discuss the future of New York City .
And in <unk> , the group of people race together , and they &apos;re <unk> to the news of New York City for the next 100 years , and the most often thought , the New York City &apos;s going to be there .
Why ? Because they look at the curve on the funnel , and say , if the population gets to develop this ratio , to move a population of New York City , they need to be able to deal with a <unk> , and the waste from six million horses will not have a way to deal with
They &apos;re going to be flooded with the horse .
So in <unk> , they saw this kind of <unk> <unk> that made a life in New York City <unk> .
So what happened ? In the course of 40 years , until the year 1900 , there were about 85 <unk> company produced company .
The idea of finding another technology that has been totally disconnected from all and has tiny factories in the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> . Henry Ford .
However , there &apos;s a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to bring them to the security .
No , they won &apos;t come up to talk to you .
Then you have to bring them to a great service , and they &apos;re very keen .
And then you have to tell them about business .
The largest company , the largest company , has to have a <unk> , to be able to do the next thing : the product you want to sell to , you have to have a <unk> strategy , and you have to have the very <unk> governance .
Think about what ?
We never met any individual around the world , who just made it , sold it and managed to be the same .
That doesn &apos;t exist .
This animal has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at the <unk> company in Carnegie Mellon , <unk> , Edison , Jessica , Ford , all the new company , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that every organization of companies in the world have , just one that is not one of the memes that you can start with .
We were teaching the teenagers to go to 16 years of <unk> in <unk> , and we started class by giving them two first input of Richard <unk> &apos;s biography of Richard <unk> , and the job for the ages of 16 years is the <unk> , and the first two <unk> of the <unk>
Never come from &quot; I , &quot; and I call &quot; that &quot; 32 times . &quot;
He didn &apos;t start alone .
<unk> Who started a company . Nobody .
So we can create a community where people have an experienced <unk> of business models in a small <unk> , <unk> bar , and your friends who are going to make you what someone has made for you , &quot; What
Can you do what ? You do it ?
okay , you can sell it ? Can you manage money ?
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t do this . &quot; You want me to find somebody else ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have volunteers who aid <unk> <unk> , and they help find resources and human and we discover that the magic from the human intelligence is something like , if you can challenge the culture , and the economic potential , and the potential of the human imagination , and the
Thank you .
So for the March three , 2011 , I made a <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We are the green creatures .
The hidden mystery in the room can &apos;t empty , and generally avoid sunlight .
We put a thinner man , and the more beautiful , it turned out to be impossible , and always got some criticism on journalism , but we also had the talented artists for the past year and understand the <unk> and the photography .
In November 2011 , he was watching the situation in the home , and I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteering I was in <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a couple of days to the part of the disaster .
I , for hundreds of volunteers knew that couldn &apos;t just sit in the house , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I found the way to square town .
It &apos;s a small fishing village , and it &apos;s about 50,000 people , one of the first places that are affected by the tsunami .
The squid is recorded to more and more , and over three miles deeper in land .
Maybe imagine , the town was <unk> .
We pulled the fragments from the channel , the tunnel , the <unk> .
<unk> to school , hygiene , toilet students , are ready to innovate and restore .
We cleaned tons of individual flesh and <unk> and <unk> from the local plant plant .
We <unk> <unk> , but everybody was happy .
For a couple of weeks , volunteers and local people are looking for something .
They were looking for photos and photos and photos and <unk> and <unk> .
All of that does that .
They &apos;ve collected and talking them to protect in places around the countryside .
Not at the time that I realized these pictures are actually a very big part of these people .
When running a <unk> , to keep the revolution , they &apos;ve left all of it , all left behind .
And at the first week , I got to help a breath center in town .
I &apos;m helping to reinvent the hot water stream , giant <unk> .
This is where the idle hometown is collected .
This is where people discuss , and that day I &apos;m going to honor , because they trust me to help me wipe them out .
It was <unk> and excited . Before that , I heard it was to think out of the box , but only when I was in a really , very exciting way .
When I look through the pictures , there &apos;s a couple more of the last hundred years , and some of you in the envelope from the <unk> booth . I think , as a <unk> , I can fix my own , and I know , and I know , and I know , the other
So that night , I went to Facebook and asked some people , and to the morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , I knew to start working .
We started to fix these images .
This is the first one .
No harm , but the water was <unk> to transform her face , to be charged with precision precision precision .
If not , boy in the background will not look like you , and certainly not as bad as the images are .
In time , very luckily , many images were <unk> , and there was more <unk> , so again , again , I was on Facebook and <unk> , and I was in the year for 80 different years , and I found 80 people to help .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wished to join .
In Japan , in July , we expanded the IT towns of <unk> , far north to the town of <unk> .
Every week , we installed our equipment in the <unk> library , which was founded , and let &apos;s get people to return to his photos .
Older women sometimes have no longer seen scanner scans , but after 10 minutes , find a photo of his loss , give us to a <unk> , and then to get it to a cloud , and to get it to a cloud , and then we can get it back .
Time for restoration is a completely different story , and obviously it &apos;s <unk> of the image of the image .
It can take a hour . It can lose a week .
It can be able to lose every month .
The <unk> in this image is almost to be done by hand , or <unk> , from the purple parts and the rest of the details , not yet harm .
It &apos;s very time-consuming .
Now , all of this picture has been <unk> , <unk> in the saltwater , covered in salt , in the bank alone , sometimes in oil , for a while , and they &apos;re going to be very <unk> .
We can &apos;t fix if the images are <unk> , dry and <unk> .
We &apos;ve been lucky with <unk> .
There &apos;s a wonderful woman who &apos;s got a wonderful woman who &apos;s <unk> us .
It &apos;s very easy to harm these images .
My <unk> <unk> was once saying , &quot; It &apos;s like a tattoo .
You don &apos;t have a <unk> chance .
The woman brought us these photos , and he had a lottery that was <unk> .
She cleaned them up , and she stopped getting them to realize that he was doing something more damage .
She also had a copy of the image .
If not , places like your husband and their faces , will never be worn out , just able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to stay together in another kind of a fresh image , and do the entire picture .
When we got to get documented from us , she shared a little bit of his story .
These pictures were blessed with her husband &apos;s own <unk> , and in a fire , the <unk> of the long highway since the house had been destroyed , and they realized he .
Day , you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
He had to go to the water when the pitch was coming up .
Two little boys , no longer , and there are no kids &apos; sons , all the boys are in school , two different schools .
A child was stuck in water .
It took a week , she found them and knew that they all survived .
I &apos;d returned to her , and I was also the youngest of her son &apos;s son &apos;s son .
For her , after all , all of this photographs were the perfect gift for him , something that could be able to see , to remember the past before that was not <unk> by the day of the month , and that was the entire life .
After six months in Japan , <unk> volunteers have been involved in <unk> <unk> , in which hundreds of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- -- Most of the photos -- most of the photos of the human owner .
Over the year of the global volunteers helped to pay more than 90 families , hundreds of photos were completely completely recovered and made .
In this time , we didn &apos;t spend a thousand dollars for equipment and materials , and most of the cost was the <unk> ink .
We took a picture of it .
Each image suggests who or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They are the <unk> of the memory and our story , which is the last thing we &apos;re <unk> and also the first thing we &apos;re going to go to .
That &apos;s the meaning of the entire project , restoring tiny <unk> of humanity , bringing to someone else .
When a picture like this is taken back , it would create a huge shift in the lives of the human experience .
The project also creates a big difference in the lives of people who are <unk> .
For some people , they &apos;ve been connected to something big , giving a job , and using some of another , and some of the more than the soft models and the skin <unk> .
I &apos;d like to read a email to finish this talk . This is from <unk> , who helped me fix , send me back to the Japanese .
&quot; When work , I can &apos;t think of each individual and stories that contain in photographs .
There &apos;s a picture , and a lot of women in the house , from age to children , stood around with a baby , and she had a <unk> , and I had a similar photo , and my mother , my mother , my picture , and my daughter , my <unk> , and my daughter , and my
On the other side , whether at the age of day , our basic need for us , is , is , is it ? &quot;
Thank you .
I was at close to <unk> , and I was at close to the <unk> in Ghana .
Not pure air and a hot gas , and it &apos;s hard breathing .
I can feel the collision from <unk> <unk> <unk> through darkness , but I can &apos;t see anything .
I heard voices , but almost the <unk> was <unk> , and the silence was <unk> by <unk> tools .
As people , I wear a cheap <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is attached to old rubber rings , and I almost never see the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down the ground .
When I missed my hand , I was not bothered by the miners who had a new day before <unk> fell off to the river .
When I talk to you today , these people are still in the hole , risking your life without food or labor , and often will die .
I was <unk> from that hole , and I was home , but they probably wouldn &apos;t be home , because there was been to the slave <unk> .
In the last 28 years , I collect local literature on the more entrepreneurial literature , and over the course of 2009 , and 2009 , I &apos;ve been honored to be the only one in the <unk> Conference of the Vancouver <unk> .
In the amazing <unk> of my <unk> , I met a <unk> for the <unk> of the Edith <unk> , an NGO in the early genocide of the modern trade slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and actually , I started to learn about slavery because I knew that it existed in the world , but not that .
After the talk , I see that really terrible and shame , because ignorance about this <unk> in my life , and I think , if I don &apos;t know , how many people will not know ?
It started punch , so some weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to see the <unk> <unk> director and asked them to help .
And from that journey , it started the modern journey of the modern world .
The old Latin I had been to the most of these places .
Some places I think like my house .
But this time , I want to see the truth being hidden now .
A conservative estimation for us that there are 27 million people are <unk> in the world today .
That &apos;s twice the number of people that are lifted from Africa during the <unk> of the <unk> .
150 years ago , a <unk> farm had a three times more than the year .
It &apos;s equivalent to 50,000 U.S. dollars today .
But today , many family generations are <unk> by many <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , slave slavery to a year is 13 billion dollars a year .
Many people were deceived by the <unk> promise of good education , better work , just to see that they were forced to work under violent <unk> , and not escape .
The <unk> of today &apos;s trade trade , which the slaves produce , but the people who create them are <unk> .
The slavery of slaves are almost nearly as nearly anywhere in the world , whether it &apos;s illegal .
In India and Nepal , I was brought to a <unk> .
This beautiful visual landscape is like walking into the ancient Egyptian world , or <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in a more <unk> temperature than 54 degrees , men , women , children , children , all families , all the family , have <unk> in the blind <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> and his total genius , they shut them up , repetitive over to 16 or 17 hours every day .
No food , hours to eat , because it &apos;s heavy water , so it &apos;s gone to fall .
<unk> and <unk> spread everywhere , my camera was heated by the point that my <unk> would not hit the stop stop .
For 20 minutes , I had to run back to the honeybee , to wipe out the <unk> and to <unk> them under the recovery heat , and when I sat there , I thought , my camera was also a lot more treatment .
Come back to the back , I just want to cry , but the <unk> is <unk> to me quickly taking me and says , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . &quot;
He explained that it was very <unk> , and it was very dangerous , and it wasn &apos;t me , and it was not me .
I couldn &apos;t live directly to them .
I didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I &apos;m not the citizens .
I can put them in the worse situation of their current .
I had to rely on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to release them , and I believe they can .
For me , I had to wait to go to the door to really feel pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw children <unk> in a <unk> rock in the van waiting in the driveway .
The big rocks are more than the children who bring them , they <unk> them up with their <unk> using the <unk> , the rope and the <unk> .
<unk> are so heavy .
How do we create this <unk> , and also what happens as this ?
Some people don &apos;t even know that they &apos;re <unk> to be <unk> , they work not 16 hours every day , for their entire life .
They don &apos;t have anything to compare .
When this person of this village required free , their cleaner <unk> <unk> .
These people don &apos;t have anything , they die , they want to be transparent , but women in the middle of the country and <unk> people who are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> to help them get their <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re
We often think of sexual trade as we heard from &quot; slavery &quot; and this insight , and I &apos;m also informed that it will be hard to work in this particular industry .
In <unk> , I was raised by the women who were <unk> .
They took me down to the stairs down to the <unk> basement , which is just a little bit of a light .
This is actually not the mass .
It &apos;s like a restaurant .
<unk> , like knowing in the industry , are the <unk> of prostitution .
Every place where there is a small room , where the slaves , the women , the same kids and girls , and some ages seven , are <unk> to the client , and they buy the wine and the food .
sleeping rooms are dirty and dark , and they &apos;re found by the Lego on the wall of the molecule , because the <unk> and the <unk> .
The people who are in favor are often <unk> sexual abuse under the <unk> .
At the top of the corner , I remember feeling the fear of being , and second , I got a prison in that bowl of hell .
Only one way : the staircase is from me .
There &apos;s no <unk> .
There &apos;s no big windows that come up .
These people don &apos;t have any escape , when we talk about the topic of harder , to remember that slave , slave crime has sex , and then we &apos;re living in the workplace .
Thousands of people are <unk> in farming , in restaurants , full of <unk> in my house , and the list lists .
Recently , the New York Times reported that 100,000 to the American children were sold to the <unk> of the U.S. <unk> every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We don &apos;t see it .
The textile industry also thought to be about slave slavery .
I went to the village in India , where many families were <unk> in silk sales .
This is the family portrait .
<unk> <unk> are the father , the blue hands and the red son .
They mix <unk> in the big tanks , and dip silk to that .
My translator &apos;s translation stories .
They said , &quot; We don &apos;t have freedom .
But there &apos;s hope for any day that can be left with this house and go somewhere else where we &apos;re <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> that there are over 4,000 children doing the slaves on Volta &apos;s <unk> , the largest artificial memory .
The first time I went to see one .
I saw the scene as a family was fighting on the boat , two boys , and some little kids , were kind of logical ?
Wrong . They &apos;re slaves .
Kids are taken from the family , and they &apos;re selling and <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to stop in these boats , whether they don &apos;t know .
This child eight .
He <unk> when our sailboat came to close , and he had his <unk> <unk> his little <unk> .
He was terrified of fear falling down .
<unk> <unk> tucked into the van , usually in the fishing nets , and the children were tired of <unk> to <unk> the water to break themselves up .
They die .
And what he remembered , was that I was arrested .
The <unk> , I don &apos;t dare to escape , and because of the <unk> , and I &apos;d like to do that down to the smaller <unk> that I manage .
I met these boys at five o &apos;clock in the morning , when they were pulling the last net , but they worked from a hour .
At night night , dark beetles .
It takes that that these nets are close to <unk> when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce Kofi Annan with you .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
I met him in the rescue ward of the <unk> of slaves .
Here you are shower in the front of the front of the room , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re great , and I &apos;m sitting talking today , Kofi Annan are united with the families , and more and more and more .
Kofi are the embodiment .
Who would you become a person who would be standing up and changed my life ?
<unk> on the street in Ghana , also in the <unk> of the <unk> Airport , a friend of <unk> who followed <unk> <unk> <unk> up to the top of our car and knocked into the glass .
He told us to go on the <unk> of <unk> .
At the end of the road , he allies us from the car , and he tries to drive .
And just this blurry footprint and said , &quot; This is the walking walk , and you go . &quot;
So , we <unk> the <unk> , and after an hour of a <unk> , trace the traces in the surrounding rain , so I wore the <unk> , so I went down to the water , and we went down to the water , and
After two hours , the trace around spontaneously end up in the corner of the empty , and we were a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they filled the slaves .
A lot of women in the back are <unk> , and in the water of the toxic water toxic water .
The smallpox stopped in the process .
These guys were <unk> by the <unk> in a different area of Ghana .
When I came out of the basement , people were wet by sweat .
I remember looking at the <unk> eyes , their fatigue because of many people in the ground to 72 hours .
The tunnels came to the hundred meters , they got up to the <unk> bags that were <unk> to the other section , which is <unk> to try to take the gold .
Look through , the <unk> <unk> looks full of healthy people , but when you look at close , there are bad luck than working in extreme situations , including children .
They are all victims of compassion , disease and violence .
In fact , there are many of these muscles who are ultimately going to be like this one , who are <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a few years .
This is <unk> . When my father died , he was sent to the <unk> to work .
When the uncle loses , <unk> <unk> of the debt , and being forced to be <unk> in this bush longer .
When I met , he worked 14 years in the mines , and the wound is the right foot that you see here from a disaster in mine , a <unk> foot that you can tell .
All over there , <unk> had been sick , but still got to work through the day in the basement .
And yet , he still dreamed of being to be able to get to school with the help of local activists like the <unk> <unk> , and determination like this , on the face of strangers , and make me overwhelmed with the <unk> .
I want to get a slave to get out .
When I worked in this field , I carried a lot of candles , with the help of the translator , and I approved with people I &apos;d taken to see the story and their circumstances , and so I was safe and I was safe and I was safe and I was safe and
They know their pictures will be seen by the other guys out there .
I want them to know that we will be able to prove them , and we will do anything that can help them to change their lives .
I really believe , if we take people like the people who are like , they &apos;re very hard to drill down <unk> crimes .
The images are not about yourself . They &apos;re about people , who are , like you and me , all it deserves , and it &apos;s all about religion , honor and respect as the same in life .
There &apos;s no day that I don &apos;t think of the amazing people that are <unk> , I have the big honor to meet them .
I hope that the images will be able to <unk> a source of power in the viewer , and people like you , and hopefully that power will <unk> fire , and that fire will shine in the <unk> , because there &apos;s no light , the monster &apos;s monster .
Thank you very much .
