How do I show in 10 minutes of the mycelium wire that are made of women who live in three generations of <unk> , how powerful the wires are taken up , and they &apos;re taking a life of a nine-year-old girl , and she &apos;s <unk> , and she &apos;s not going to
This story has no idea .
It &apos;s a <unk> game .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : A man burning a fire full of life .
He was a poet , theater , who was a <unk> life on the telescope hoping that his country would have freedom .
Imagine he &apos;d , the progressive community in <unk> <unk> , facing the fact that his life wasted .
It &apos;s from the year , and it &apos;s five months of <unk> you &apos;re at hand .
He <unk> to silence .
He died , and she had <unk> history .
He &apos;s my grandfather .
I never met him .
But our life more than what we &apos;re <unk> in memories .
My grandmother never allowed me to forget my life .
My mission is not to life through infinity , and my lesson is to realize that , yes , history has tried to fall hurt us , but we &apos;ve been blessed .
The next piece of the picture is a <unk> in a early <unk> <unk> .
My mother , <unk> , 18 years old , when my mother died -- had raised family , a marriage named after , and there were two little girls .
With her mother , her life <unk> into the only task : to get out of parents and start to start life in Australia .
Never accepted my mother to not succeed .
So after four years , a failed field of discrimination , a <unk> <unk> , was a <unk> <unk> called fishing fishing boats .
All the big people know the risk .
The biggest fear is to steal , rape , and death .
Like most adults in the boat , my mother brought a mini bottle .
If we were caught , first of all , I was my sister and I , and she would take me .
The earliest memories I remember being from the boat -- the engine is all , the <unk> , the <unk> of the boat in every wave of a <unk> , black <unk> .
I don &apos;t remember giving a break , but was <unk> by the contractions of men on boat , or when the wires were dead and not going to be born for six hours .
But I remember the light from the oil wing from the gyre of <unk> and a young man who died through his life , the end of the journey is <unk> with him , and the first bold result I was <unk> , the apple that the public was , and the other
There &apos;s no good apple .
After three months of <unk> camp , we put to Melbourne .
And the next piece of the picture is about four women , three generations together , oriented the new life .
We &apos;re going to <unk> in <unk> , suburbs for civil labor in there .
Unlike the steady <unk> suburbs , I don &apos;t know if there exists , there is no rights at <unk> .
<unk> from all walks of all around the world .
And the English pieces of English <unk> in the conversation between people who have one in common , they &apos;re starting to start at the beginning .
My mother worked in the farm , and he made a <unk> , working season , six songs .
And yet she still tastes a time to English and take a technology of information .
We are very poor .
Each of them is all counted and more English and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s not a new clothes ; they &apos;re the old clothes ; our clothes are always old .
Two double things to go to school , each to cover the hole on other .
A <unk> , personal brass , because we spend a moment for six years .
Sometimes , although , I hear that the fun of ripping &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> &quot; and sometimes drawing on the wall : &quot; The Asian Asian , liberal <unk> . &quot;
Where are home ?
There &apos;s a little bit of tougher .
The determination of the privilege and a voice voice says , &quot; I &apos;m going to go through all the <unk> . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I went to a bed .
My mother was so frustrated , but we told each other to hear the story and heard my grandmother walking around .
My mother was <unk> by the boat .
My mission was to come to the moment when she was <unk> to call her mother .
She opens the computer and studied <unk> and <unk> and an entrepreneur .
And then the women came to tell their story about men who couldn &apos;t fit into the new life , anger and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
We find subsidies and <unk> .
The centers are set .
I live in the parallel worlds .
In a world , I &apos;m the classic <unk> student , and it &apos;s a hard moment to be in my own .
In the other world , I struck in the <unk> of the <unk> , tragic <unk> because violence , heroin and <unk> .
But over the course of a long period of time , many children were helped .
And because that operation , when I &apos;m the senior student student , I &apos;m elected by the <unk> &apos; Australian College .
And I was blown from this piece of metal into another piece , but they couldn &apos;t fit together .
Tan Le , who &apos;s anonymous in the <unk> area , is a turquoise disorder , and the social activist , the <unk> , invited to speak at the places that she never heard about , but she never imagined that she had never seen
I don &apos;t know the patterns .
I don &apos;t know how to use a plate .
I don &apos;t know about wine .
I don &apos;t know what to talk about .
I &apos;d like to take a job on the <unk> of everyday <unk> and <unk> in the suburbs of the suburbs , and no one knows -- the grandmother , the mother and the two daughters that are <unk> every day , and the next time you &apos;re in the course of the next 20 years , and it &apos;s all about the
I told her I couldn &apos;t do it .
She said , I was with my mother as well as when we were on our boat .
&quot; No choice . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t make it , &quot; and you say , &quot; And don &apos;t try to be somebody else . &quot;
So I talked about <unk> , and education , and about the social people , were lost , and left .
And the more I said , the more I got invited .
I met people from all the social class , so many people who were working on them , they loved , living at the base of the opportunity .
And I &apos;m good at my college , and I realize I can &apos;t afford a law .
The top line needs a piece of a piece .
And at the same time I realized that the <unk> was also <unk> , who came , and not just but not only , but one thing we needed to see , maybe a gift from the boat .
Because the people who stand in the shoes can be confined to the visibility , maybe easily welcome the assumptions of your <unk> .
Now I &apos;ve been out in my own <unk> &apos; <unk> , and I &apos;m going to know , yes , the world can collapse but not in the way that you fear .
The possibility that previously would not be allowed to be promoted .
There is a source of energy , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of humility and adventure .
So I went in my spirit .
I collected a small team with us , &quot; No , &quot; which is not a compelling challenge .
For a year we didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
At East days , I made a huge soup for us to eat .
We worked at night at night .
Most of our ideas were mad , but some great ideas , and we created disruptive breakthroughs .
I decided to move to the United States .
After having a journey .
Again , the hunch .
Three months later I moved the status and the adventure on the next .
Before I finished , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up in the age of <unk> , the <unk> , and the local <unk> , the power of the power .
Life has been that way for centuries .
Her father had lost immediately after she was born .
Her mother grew her up .
In 17 years old , she became two halves of a man who touched her .
And the oil was <unk> , and she suffered when he turned to court , and she started to trigger , and also <unk> , and even more powerful when she won .
&quot; No . &quot; &quot; Nothing &quot; is being discovered .
I &apos;m in a hotel hotel room in the moment of her lost 600 miles , in Melbourne .
I looked through the glass and saw her standing up there .
I knew she &apos;d come to me and get me to pause .
A few minutes later my mother calls .
A few days later , we went to a Buddhist <unk> in <unk> and sat around her legacy .
We told her to <unk> and commit to her , and she was all at her side .
At midnight , a monk came to tell us he had to take his subjects .
She told us that she felt her hand .
My mother asked the master , &quot; Why is my parents warm that the man is cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because since I &apos;ve harvested her , &quot; he said .
&quot; You don &apos;t .
If there &apos;s a resource of our family , that &apos;s where we are .
Because we are who and the life that we have , and what we can see that men who have gone to our lives will be going to stop us .
<unk> will come to a very easy way .
Now I want to have a baby , and I &apos;m wondering about the boat .
Would anybody want their children to experience their ship ?
But I feared privilege , feared of pleasant life , feared ownership .
Can I give my children a boat in my life , so intense in every wave , the engine is not disconnected , the sheer sheer sky isn &apos;t promises ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I can tell that , and still I see my child , I &apos;m going to give my children .
And yes , your mother &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth row or fifth .
It &apos;s the privilege to me to be standing here and share with people .
I had to go through my long time , and in a prison , and in prison for the people who had been sentenced to death .
I also experienced a long time in the community of low-income people with projects and places where the desperation were .
And I &apos;m so encouraged to be and then I listen to this . I listen to this .
And one of the most salient things that I realized in the short period of time I came here is TED got a very solo <unk> .
And you can talk about a lot of what it has to do worldwide .
And sometimes you come to TED , it brings meaning and your strength , and you &apos;re not going to get you to get your power .
And I mentioned this because I think the identity is really important .
We have some amazing talks .
And I think what we &apos;ve seen is , if you &apos;re a teacher , your voice will mean , but if you &apos;re a rich teacher , your words are special .
If you &apos;re a doctor , you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a <unk> doctor , you can do more of the other things .
That &apos;s why I want to talk about the power of identity .
I didn &apos;t learn that before I conducted a lawyer or through my work .
I actually learned this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house , and the British <unk> , and the <unk> , and my grandmother &apos;s <unk> .
She was so strong , strong and powerful in the family .
She always <unk> every single conflict every single conflict in the family .
And it &apos;s always the people who are <unk> in the families .
Parents actually are the <unk> of slaves .
Her parents were born in the slavery of Virginia in the late 1800s .
And she lives in the late 1800s and had to experience the date of <unk> , which was exactly what she looked at .
She was solid , but he also <unk> himself .
When I was a kid , whenever I looked at her , she would come up and hug me .
She held me down to me , and I felt hard to breathe . She &apos;d let me go .
Or maybe two hours later , if I met her going to work and said , &quot; Ah , are you still feeling like you hug ? &quot;
And if I said , &quot; <unk> , she will . &quot; I &apos;ll be going to &quot; attack &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> , she &apos;ll leave me with me .
<unk> in a way that you will always want to be close .
The only challenge is she has 10 children .
My mother was the youngest .
Sometimes , I went and I was on her , but it was hard to get her to mind .
My cousin kept around her everywhere .
And I remember , at the time , about eight , nine years old , and I woke up , and I woke up , into the living room and I saw all my cousins running around , and I was
My grandmother was sitting in front of me .
At the beginning , I thought we were playing a game .
And I looked at her and laughed , but she seemed to be very serious .
Fifteen , 20 minutes pass her up , crossing my room , and she says , &quot; Come , <unk> . She &apos;s going to talk to you . &quot;
I remember the printing page , and I thought , &quot; Yesterday , it &apos;s just about yesterday .
And I &apos;ll never forget .
She took me out of the room , and he went to the back and said , &quot; Look , you &apos;ll tell you a story , but don &apos;t tell anybody . &quot;
I said , &quot; Good . &quot;
She said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s make sure you &apos;re not going to do that . &quot;
And she sat down , and he said , &quot; You want you to know that she still follow her . &quot;
&quot; She thinks the baby is particularly exceptional . &quot;
&quot; She thinks you can do everything that you want . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget her .
And she said , &quot; You just need to promise you three things . &quot;
I said , &quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; The first thing she wants to promise is to love mother . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s her daughter &apos;s daughter , and give you a promise that it will always take care of your mother . &quot;
Well , I love my mother , so I promised my mother , so I &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
&quot; The second thing you want to promise is that , you will always make the right thing , but there is hardly going to be done . &quot;
I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
And finally she said , &quot; The third thing is that , let &apos;s say to her , never take a bar . &quot;
And so , at the time I was nine years old , and I said , &quot; Yes , I promise . &quot;
I grew up in the surrounding countryside , and there was a brother , and I was a big , older and girls , and a little girl , I was a little older .
When I was 14 , 15 years old , my grandfather went home and brought back six beer bottles , and I didn &apos;t know where he got him and the daughter comes in .
The kind of thing we were out there doing was <unk> .
He was finished with a <unk> beer , gave me a beer and she gave me a beer .
I said , &quot; No , no , no , no , no , no . You &apos;re going to drink . You don &apos;t drink a beer . &quot;
My brother says , &quot; Well , let &apos;s do this today , and you &apos;re always doing what you and the girls do . &quot;
You have a little bit , and my sister has a little drink , and he &apos;s got a little bit of money . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel like that . Two people drinks , and keep . &quot;
And then my brother looked at me .
And he said , &quot; How do you get a little ? &quot;
He looked at me , &quot; Oh , you &apos;d expect you to not be too much too much .
I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; She told all the kids that they were special . &quot;
Now , I was disappointed .
I want to admit to you .
I shouldn &apos;t tell you .
I know that this talk will be broadcast .
But I would still say , I had a couple of my 20s and I &apos;d admit to that I &apos;d never had a drink of wine .
I &apos;m not saying that I think I &apos;m doing that , right , moral morality ; I want to talk about the power of human nature .
When we create the right character we can tell everything that &apos;s going to tell us that what they don &apos;t believe is really meaningful .
We can make them go into doing things that they don &apos;t think they do .
Whenever I think about the grandmother who I know she knows she &apos;s all special .
My grandfather was in prison for the <unk> , and he had to be the <unk> .
My grandfather died for the dying .
And of course she thought there were things that we needed to commit .
I &apos;m trying to speak out of the criminal justice system .
We have a lot of people , and it &apos;s a lot of us , it &apos;s a lot of years ago .
In 1972 , there was <unk> .
Now , that number has been coming up to 2.3 million .
The United States now has the highest incarceration in the world .
And there are seven million people who are <unk> or <unk> .
I think , the <unk> , and this is a very fundamental , fundamentally , fundamental , fundamental , fundamental , accurate world .
For the poor , the people who are the <unk> of this person who have made them live with the desperation .
Three black men in the age of 18 to 30 men were in a prison , and they were <unk> or <unk> .
In the big cities of the country as Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Baltimore , D.C. , and Washington , D.C. -- 60 percent of the skin people in the same condition , they were sentenced to jail , or <unk> , or <unk> , and <unk> ,
Our laws are not just defined by the way , not just being <unk> by racial discrimination , but also distorted by the poverty .
We are having a criminal system going to be willing to treat you much better if you commit to the poor , but wealthy as poor as poor .
It &apos;s wealth , not guilty or no offense to the result .
And yet , we seem to be comfortable with this .
The fear of fear and anger have made us believe that this is not and the problem that we have to worry about .
So we separate ourselves apart .
But that made me care .
We are seeing some very interesting development .
I live in the state of Alabama , and the same states will actually steal your vote forever if you commit to criminal .
Right now , in Alabama , there &apos;s 34 percent of black men permanently lost the vote .
We predict that more than 10 years more urgent people will be going to be more likely to be weighed before the Olympic law is approved .
And there &apos;s a <unk> silence .
I want to represent the voice for children .
Many of my other pieces are very small .
America is the only country in the world who had been in the very old <unk> of prison .
We have a live prison in prison with kids .
We actually are doing a little <unk> of children .
And the only water in the world doing this .
I &apos;m going to speak to the <unk> of the inmates .
The death question is very exciting .
In many ways , we &apos;re taught to believe that the real question is whether people should be dead by evil , mistakes they cause ?
This is a very reasonable question .
But there &apos;s still a way of thinking about where we are in our personality .
How else do you think about this is not whether or not consumers are <unk> or what we have to kill them or not ?
I mean , it &apos;s hard to believe !
The US <unk> <unk> is identified in the U.S.
So , nine people were convicted of the executed death and we were trying to get out of death .
This is the terrible <unk> ratio , and one of nine people were convicted .
It &apos;s really hard to imagine .
In the fields , we &apos;ll never let people go to every nine aircraft aircraft , but there &apos;s a shot that has a shot .
But somehow we separate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
Not our burden .
Not what we need to fight , endeavor .
I &apos;m very sure about these problems .
The race and about the question of whether we deserve them .
And the interesting thing is that when I teach my students to speak about the American history of the African history , I tell them about the slavery , to talk about slavery .
<unk> -- this period started from the end of the <unk> and stretched it to World War II .
We really don &apos;t know about that .
But for the African-Americans in this country , it &apos;s a terrible age .
Many communities have been frightened of being executed .
They were afraid to be thrown out .
And the threats of terrorism should be their life .
These people and told me , &quot; You , you have talks , presentations who are not going to show us that we just don &apos;t just exist with the first time in the history of the <unk> event . &quot;
And let &apos;s tell them that we had to grow up with that .
And of course , the terror of terrorism has taken a distinction and decades of race and <unk> and <unk> .
We see this , but we don &apos;t want to talk about our own .
We don &apos;t want to talk about history .
And so , we didn &apos;t understand what that meant .
We don &apos;t stop conflict .
It doesn &apos;t stop to <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;ve been very hard to talk about race , and I believe that , because we &apos;re not willing to admit the truth and reconciliation .
In South Korea , people know that they can &apos;t fight to <unk> if they don &apos;t commit to the truth and do reconciliation .
In Rwanda , even after <unk> <unk> <unk> , there was commitment to the funding , but in this country , we still didn &apos;t .
I had some speeches in Germany about the death rate .
And so , it was amazing because my presentation , there is a scholar , and said , &quot; Actually , I &apos;m not really upset to hear what he &apos;s talking about . &quot;
&quot; In Germany , not the death penalty . &quot;
And of course , we never will have a penalty of in Germany . &quot;
The room became quiet , and this woman said , &quot; In our history , we &apos;re in the <unk> of killing the <unk> system .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t mean that it should not kill anybody . &quot;
And I think about this .
How do you feel like if you live in a world where it plays a killer , is that , when is the Hebrew Jew ?
I can &apos;t ignore it .
So , so <unk> .
In our country , in the Arab states of the elderly , it still exists in the <unk> , and you have a <unk> death sentence if the victim is black , and the <unk> of the people who are <unk> , the women who are <unk> , who are the women who are
And so , there &apos;s prevention .
I think our character is <unk> .
When we don &apos;t really care about things that are very difficult to do , but we &apos;re all going to be influenced by the <unk> .
We like to reform .
I love technology , we love to create .
adaptive .
But ultimately , this reality is still <unk> because the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> morality and see the character .
And for me , the combination of both things are actually necessary .
And yet , we &apos;re also talking about needing more to hope for more and more and more and more narrow to the fundamental challenges of life , in this complex universe .
For me , that means that for the time to think , to talk about the poor , who has a tough situation , who has a tough situation , who has no opportunity to go to TED .
But let &apos;s think about them in terms of blending with our own lives .
You know , eventually we also have to believe in what we &apos;ve never seen .
Well . We have , we play for the intelligence .
Innovation , creativity , and developing is not just a simple idea .
They &apos;re all coming from the idea that they are so empowered .
And that &apos;s the connection of the heart and the brain , the mind and the mind that I believe will make us not just attention to the bright things that are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great Jamaican leader , said about this .
&quot; When we were in Eastern Europe , responding to the oppression of us wanting to get all of that , but what we needed most was the belief of a conscious , <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the
Indeed , oriented is the core of my faith that even the TED community is so .
Is the <unk> between technology and design allow us to be human being really , when we really pay attention to the <unk> poverty , not for anybody to get the benefit and the injustice that allow us to be
Now I <unk> you that you have to get to be able to get a lot of people , and we have to experience a lot of challenges as we don &apos;t pay attention to as we don &apos;t pay attention to as we don &apos;t pay .
I mean , to the ones that are just mentioned .
I had a very big privilege , when I was a young lawyer , and I met <unk> Park .
She <unk> <unk> so much time and she walked together with his best friends , and they were <unk> <unk> , who had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who had a wonderful American woman and Virginia <unk> , who had a young woman who had her husband <unk> , and the women
These women are just coming and they talk .
Every time she &apos;s like that , she calls and says , &quot; Hey , <unk> , Ms. Park would go to town and we would be going to talk to you . &quot;
Would you like to hear ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to . &quot;
She said , &quot; Would you like to do what you were going to do when you were here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
And then I went there and I would just listen .
This is actually more <unk> for me .
There was a time I went and listened to them after some hours , Ms. Park turned to and said , &quot; Come , <unk> , let me hear the <unk> of justice by the justice of justice .
And what he was trying to do . &quot;
So I started talking about <unk> .
&quot; Well , we &apos;re trying to change injustice .
We &apos;re trying to help people convicted .
It &apos;s trying to invest with the bias and separate that gap in justice .
They tried to end the scene of the children who had been married in the same way that they weren &apos;t particularly sustainable , but they weren &apos;t particularly sustainable .
Try to do something about this .
<unk> among people who were incarcerated , they were killed .
And so we end up with the broad range .
When I said my meaning , she looked at me and said , &quot; Yes , uh . &quot;
&quot; It will make him crank , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And that &apos;s also when she <unk> <unk> came to me , put his hand on my face and said , &quot; So you must be courageous , courageous , courageous . &quot;
I really think that the TED community needs to be more brave .
We need to find a way to confront the challenges , and the problems and the <unk> that create inequality .
Because for the same , we all depend on individuals who live on this planet .
I learned very simple things to do my job .
It just taught me something very simple .
And I understood and believe that every single one of us had to be the worst of all of us .
I believe that it &apos;s true for everybody on Earth .
I think if somebody lied , they couldn &apos;t just lie .
If anybody took a product , none of their possessions , they weren &apos;t just a bucket .
I think , when you kill somebody , you &apos;re not even a killer .
And so , people are the primary price of the <unk> to be copyright protection .
I also believe that in many places in this country , and of course it &apos;s all about the world , the lack of poverty is not rich .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I really think that there are many places in conflict with the poor .
And finally , I believe that even though the fact is that this is very <unk> , exciting and very exciting , but we ultimately won &apos;t be judgment by the technology of our designs , because the intelligence of our intelligence and the <unk> , and the
And you don &apos;t consider a society by how they treat wealthy people , who have empowered and <unk> , who are the right way through the poor , who have a crime or a prison .
Because that &apos;s the consequence of what we &apos;re starting to have to see , who is we .
Occasionally , when I lost weight , I would end with that situation .
Sometimes I try to too .
I &apos;m really tired , like people who are .
Sometimes these ideas keep around us , and they &apos;re very important .
And I made the case to the kids who were very heavy .
I went to prison my boss , and it was a child who was 13 , 14 , 14 and he was allowed to be in front of the court as a big man .
I started thinking , how could this possibly be possible ?
How do a judge can turn you into a person that you &apos;re not ?
The judge is an adult , but I saw him still as a child .
And there &apos;s one night , and I &apos;m at night , and I start thinking , it &apos;s not that hard , if the judge can do that .
Well , <unk> , the judge has this power .
So , you should be a little bit .
And because I was too late , I didn &apos;t think of the system , and I started writing a petition .
I had a new , <unk> , black man , and poor people .
I started working with this petition with the title , &quot; The petition is trying to help a <unk> kid black <unk> , like an Director of <unk> , the white , 75 . &quot;
I &apos;m showing you that I have a <unk> , which is the wrong thing , the wrong behavior of police and justice .
There &apos;s a very crazy stream of how it doesn &apos;t have any right to the country , all right .
The next morning , I woke up and thought , &quot; I &apos;ve dreamed of a crazy proposal or I really wrote it ?
In the panic , not only I wrote it , but I also sent it to court .
A couple months goes , I &apos;m not going to forget about this .
And finally I decided I would go to the court and I had this hard case .
I walked into the car , and I felt very <unk> .
I went to the car and I went to the court .
I think this is hard to be difficult .
And finally I came from the car , and I went out to court .
And when I walked up to the metal of the <unk> , a big black man , I was the <unk> .
When this man saw me , he moved towards me and said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; You are the lawyers . &quot; He said , &quot; You &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; Yes . &quot;
And he went to close and embraced me .
<unk> silently go into my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I had to tell you that that &apos;s going to make me full of <unk> .
It has a profound connection to the humanity that I personally , about the ability to contribute to each other , for the hope of hope .
I went to the studio .
And when I walked into the room , judges saw me .
He said , &quot; You , you have to write this crazy petition ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot; And then we started to argue .
People started in the room because they were angry .
I wrote these crazy things .
<unk> and <unk> are diving .
Before I arrived , the department department was busy , and they were angry about what we talked about , and we talked about ethnicity , about poverty , and about injustice .
And yet , I can &apos;t stand in front of me , but I can still see the people holding the <unk> .
He always looked at the window , and he could hear all his <unk> .
He goes to go back to me .
He walked into the room and sat behind me , and I was very close to the lawyers .
About 10 minutes after the judge announced the <unk> .
In the meantime , the mayor of police saw that <unk> were <unk> because of the <unk> running in the lab .
He jumps to her <unk> .
and said , &quot; Jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
And this black man stood up and looked at the <unk> district and he looked at him , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m here to tell the man to be honest in the quest for his justice . &quot;
I went to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral supply on this life is long , but it rings up the rules , and it &apos;s going to be exactly where it &apos;s going to be
Knowing that we can &apos;t do human beings to actually come to us when we &apos;re interested in rights and causality .
That &apos;s what we associate with all of our <unk> <unk> with each other .
That &apos;s what we all think of all of our technology and design , entertainment and creativity must always be accompanied with the vision of the community , compassion and justice .
Over and over and over , with these things I just simply said to you , let &apos;s go to your goal to the next , and keep the trajectory .
Thank you very much .
So you &apos;ve heard of your <unk> and the audience , the TED community to help you on your path and do something for this .
Instead of raising money , what can we help ?
Well , there are a lot of opportunity around us .
For example , if you live in the United States , this spring would have a referendum here , we were trying to redefine a part of the money using the punishment .
So for example , at <unk> , we &apos;ll spend a million dollars for a penalty of a <unk> penalty in five years . Yes , a million dollars .
And 46 percent of the murder of the killing case .
56 percent of the crime cases were not handled .
So we have a chance to change this situation .
And the referendum will give to the petition to get money to get to work and make a job of law .
And I think the opportunity is all around us .
The U.S. in the United States had dropped a lot of time .
And part of that story is sometimes because of the time for time .
What are you going to tell you about ?
In fact , the violence rate is still at the same time as well .
The rate of being arrested in the United States , growing up , is actually not violent .
This is a fight against drug drugs .
And the number of people that are arrested to be very significant .
And we &apos;ve lost control for the face of the punishment .
And so , we have three wars fighting people who are in common by stealing bicycle or <unk> <unk> , rather than forcing them to give their humanity .
I believe that we need to do more things to help people who are being turned into victims by crimes , not doing less .
I think the <unk> of our current <unk> is <unk> , which is not for anybody .
I think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you actually have to <unk> the psychology of people here .
He &apos;s really an inspiring person .
Thank you for coming to TED . Again , thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about a little idea .
The drift of the boundaries of the lines
And because that idea can be explained in a minute . I &apos;ll tell you three stories before to fill up time .
The first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes hero .
He came up for the years , and he knew quite well .
And you think he &apos;d go to catch the Mt , but not .
Actually he collected the fish .
He described one of them . &quot;
This is the <unk> fish .
A large <unk> <unk> <unk> is coming up with this <unk> .
Now the fish are now in the Indian List .
This story we &apos;ve heard a lot about the Galapagos and the other places that don &apos;t have to be special about it .
But the point is , we still go to the Galapagos .
We still think it &apos;s <unk> .
The ads are still information that they &apos;re not touched .
So what happens here ?
The second story , still to be able to solve a different concept called the <unk> of hip sugar .
I went there in <unk> , and I went to the <unk> in West Africa .
I went there because <unk> grew up in Europe and wanted to be done in Africa .
Though I can fit with life .
I had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was convinced that I was not so honest .
This is my first <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is surrounded by your paintbrush can see , some mangroves .
There &apos;s about 20 inches an illegal animal with a <unk> , with the <unk> , black mold .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the population , and they actually have a very <unk> <unk> , they get more than the average income income in Ghana .
27 years after I came back , the size of this fish just half goes .
They reach the adult age in the <unk> .
There &apos;s a gene that &apos;s on this .
There are lots of fish .
They &apos;re still very good .
And these fish seem to be comfortable at there .
So there &apos;s nothing that changed , but everything changed .
The third story is that when I was the gay , I was the gay Show <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia .
In the <unk> years , there &apos;s no , not , start from Europe &apos; <unk> , very much of the development projects .
The <unk> of fishing that it meant to put on those countries that had 100,000 prisoners switched in <unk> fishing fields .
And this boat , quite <unk> , is called <unk> 4 .
I use it to do the <unk> of the South Atlantic <unk> of China and particularly the ocean Sea .
What we &apos;ve got , we don &apos;t find it from the word
What we &apos;ve got , now I knew that it was the bottom of the ocean .
Ninety percent of what we were putting were <unk> , and other creatures were <unk> down the floor .
And most of the other fish are very small , like the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> , are fish living in the coral reefs .
The main thing is that the bottom of the ocean &apos;s <unk> is <unk> back to the limb .
These images are so <unk> because this transition is so quick .
Within a year , you do a survey after the commercial fishing industry .
The ocean is <unk> in this <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> is a mess <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
These are not passive , they &apos;re thrown away because they &apos;re dead .
And once we started a kid alive .
It &apos;s not yet <unk> .
So they wanted to kill it , so they were so tasty .
This mountain of debris actually collected by fishermen in the times they go to the uncharted Valley , and it never once won &apos;t get before .
But this is not recorded by documentation .
We converted the world , but we don &apos;t remember this .
We <unk> our own <unk> curve , and we don &apos;t remember how it &apos;s before .
If you generalize this , something like this will happen .
We have some good things from the <unk> here , and the biodiversity of the killer whales of your country , the water supply .
It &apos;s going to change it , because it &apos;s going to change because of human beings doing something about it .
Each generation will use images that they have from the beginning of life as a standard and will be going to happen .
The difference then is that they are aware of that .
But they didn &apos;t get to get the thing that happened before .
You can do a whole range of connections with continuity .
And then you want to keep the rest of the world .
And that , with greater density , is what we want to do now .
We want to maintain things that are not even anymore or something that otherwise doesn &apos;t .
People should think that this issue affects people that , as well as the &quot; bait flower &quot; -- they kill animals and they don &apos;t know how to do that after several generations .
Because , obviously , a species with a very rich number of <unk> , before it was extinct .
So you don &apos;t lose animals with the number of abundance .
You just lose the <unk> animals .
So they &apos;re not considered such a huge aversion .
Over time we focus on the big animals in the ocean , we focus on big fish .
They become more and more vulnerable because we &apos;re getting them .
Over time we just have a little fish and we think this is the <unk> line .
The question is , why do everybody accept this ?
And they don &apos;t know if they &apos;re so different .
In fact , many people , and scientists are going to argue that before it &apos;s really very different .
They would argue that this because the discovery that &apos;s shown earlier is not going to follow the way they want it to be shown .
For example , the story of the story , some people have told the Captain who are seeing a lot of fish in this area that cannot be used , or not used by the scientists who are <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t have compressed intellectual <unk> , and the
So you have a situation in which people don &apos;t know about the past even if they &apos;re living in society , because they don &apos;t trust what has existed past the past .
And so , the big role in the ocean is preserved .
Because with the <unk> states that are protected , we actually <unk> the past .
We regenerate the past , which people can &apos;t perceive it because the <unk> line has been moved and in the extreme position .
It &apos;s for people who can see that the ocean is protected and people who can benefit from deep insights that leads them to <unk> their <unk> .
So what can the people do that do that ? Because they don &apos;t have the next resort to the <unk> in the Middle East ?
I think the arts and movies can <unk> , and the simulation .
This is the simulation of the Gulf of <unk> .
And very long ago in the Gulf of <unk> , the 800 years ago .
You might have noticed that color and sound like &quot; Avatar . &quot;
<unk> , if you think about &quot; impactful &quot; may , if you think about all the <unk> -- so it &apos;s <unk> people like <unk> don &apos;t notice the story of <unk> , why <unk> the symbol of the icon to how to
Because it <unk> something that &apos;s <unk> .
And so my suggestion is , this is the only thing I want to give to the director of the &quot; Avatar to do &quot; with the bottom . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Do you know how much of the choice is a day ?
Do you know how much of the choice is in a week ?
Recently , I &apos;ve been investigating over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of options that the Native Americans have been doing is about 70 times a day .
There was a survey that was done with CEOs that we were following the CEO for a week .
And scientists have led all the different tasks that are involved in and they &apos;ve spent a lot of time to do the decision to do .
And they found that the average CEO did about <unk> , the mission for a week .
Of course , every single task is made out of lots of little choices .
Fifty percent of the people &apos;s decisions are destined nine minutes .
And only the 12 percent of the decision is they &apos;ve made them practice in a second or so .
Now , think about your own choices .
How much choices do you know about you spend about nine minutes ?
What are you thinking about that you &apos;re good at managing those choices ?
Today , I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of our choice , which is a problem with many choices .
I want to talk about problems and solutions .
And when I &apos;m going to do this , I &apos;ll have some questions for you and I hope to be heard from you .
So when I ask you a question , I don &apos;t see , if you want to burn a dose of calories , just raises high hand .
If you don &apos;t , when I ask , and if you &apos;re like yes , you &apos;re happy .
Now the first question today , is , you know , you &apos;re willing to hear about the problem with the <unk> ?
Thank you .
When I was graduate student at Stanford University , I used to be very <unk> grocery stores , and I was pretty rich .
This is the store with <unk> .
Now it &apos;s almost as much as the amusement park .
They have 250 different kinds of fruit and lots of mustard and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more than two different types of water and that is that we &apos;re actually very often eating water .
I &apos;d like to be in this store , but nature , I used to ask myself how to come and buy anything ?
This is their <unk> oil .
They have over 75 different oils , including all kinds of different kinds of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
So , one day , I decided to go to the manager , and I asked , &quot; What about the gay agenda has really worked ? &quot;
And he &apos;s just a regular crowd of travel and <unk> and popular crowd , and every single day , the camera is <unk> .
We decided to do a little experiment , and we took <unk> to the experiment .
Here &apos;s their <unk> .
They have more than 70,000 types of <unk> .
We opened a little taste <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We brought six different kinds of smell or 24 varieties of smell , and we realized that two things : The one thing , what the one , in case everybody wanted to stop , tried some different kinds of apples ?
Many people stopped , about 60 percent when we gave 24 <unk> , and when only six categories , there were 40 percent .
The next thing we realized in the case of what people loved one bottle of wine .
We &apos;re now seeing the response .
In the <unk> , when we gave 24 years of , there were three percent of them bought a bottle of <unk> .
And the ones who stopped the six <unk> , or only six types of <unk> , and suddenly we saw 30 percent of that .
Now , try to do a minimum of a <unk> math , which is six times more than the number of people who want to buy a bottle of <unk> as they see a <unk> bottle of <unk> .
Now no talking about the option of choice can be better for us to be at least better for us to be better for our backyard for example , and we have shown that the problem is that the problem is that we can &apos;t even give us a decision that we can &apos;t even
We choose not to choose even if that &apos;s going to be <unk> for us .
The theme today will continue : saving financial saving .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a lesson that I &apos;ve got with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> where we look at the savings decisions of the collective world , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And what we see is that the number of resources that are available in the <unk> plan of the 401 plan have a impact on the ability to save more .
And what we found is that there &apos;s a correlation .
So in those strategies , we had <unk> planning , powered by volunteers in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And we found that the more resources are coming out , and it &apos;s actually the lowest rate .
So if you look closely at the planning of the <unk> , you have two major <unk> financial resources joined in the middle of the 1970s , not as much as we are .
In the financial plan plans , <unk> of corruption , the corruption of the existing sector , has halved .
Now , it shows that even you can choose to participate when there are more than the present choices , there are negative consequences .
For those of you who choose to join the more choices more than the more choices are going to be .
More than many other options , the more people sending all their money to the financial accounts .
Now not those options are the choices that anyone in us also refer to as you &apos;re considering the financial talents .
Over the past decade , we &apos;ve seen three existential results that we &apos;ve made for people that make a lot of choice .
They like to delay <unk> <unk> even when it comes to the best benefit to themselves .
They seem to be getting worse , more than any worse in finance , health .
They seem to be choosing to do less , so they &apos;re less satisfied when they &apos;re better .
The reason is that , because we can love to look at the big wall of <unk> <unk> , mustard , <unk> , but we couldn &apos;t do the math of the book and the contrast and even from the surprising to the surprising <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the
So what I want to suggest is that today &apos;s four technical engineering techniques that we &apos;ve tested with many ways in a more recent survey , you can apply to your business business .
First . End exchange .
It was heard that before , but that &apos;s not true , but it &apos;s not true .
Everyone was always embarrassed when I said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
They always worry about their own . They &apos;re going to be going to lose their position .
But in fact , the more we see that if you &apos;re willing to cut rid of eliminating the choice in the <unk> of revenues in revenues increases down to the cost , and that &apos;s the improvements in the choices that are the outcomes you have .
When the <unk> &amp; amp ; Gamble is <unk> from 26 <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
When the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was spent the worst sold of the cats who noticed that increases in profit on <unk> percent of the revenues increase and amputation costs .
You know , the average store of grocery stores can show you <unk> products .
Walmart , at <unk> , takes you 100,000 products .
But the <unk> selling <unk> selling nine retail outlets were now <unk> , and it just posed a <unk> seed which is packaged in a <unk> .
Now in the world saving financial media , I think one of the best examples to do that is that David <unk> has to do with designing that design program , and it &apos;s the first chapter in Harvard .
Each one of the people who worked in <unk> was signed in a form .
For those of you who really want to choose them to give 20 financial resources or more than that .
People often say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut . &quot;
All of this is all the kind of important choice .
And the first thing I did was I asked them to tell me how different alternative choices were .
And if your partner does not tell you , your consumers are .
When we started our part , this afternoon , I had a conversation with Gary .
And Gary said that he was willing to help people in this one of the most comfortable , the most comfortable one of the world .
This is the description of human .
And I think you should read it .
Now I &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read it after you &apos;d be willing to get your hand ready .
Good . Those guys are willing to get the suggestion from Gary .
SW : Are it done ?
Now I &apos;m going to show you more .
You know , this is the kind of <unk> , right .
Now , who are ready for this expedition ?
I think I &apos;ll hear more noise .
All right .
<unk> , you have a lot of information that says , once the second time , but I &apos;ll try to make a try and make a sense that you feel that it &apos;s more than the second .
Because the painting itself is more realistic .
And that gave me the second technology of dealing with the problem that I &apos;m choosing to deal with .
That to make people understand the difference between choices that they have to understand the outcome of each choice and the outcomes that they need to feel very clear , deep and deeper and profound and inspiring choices , and that they need to understand the results that are required to understand the outcomes that are
Why do everybody use the average 15 to 30 percent when they &apos;re using <unk> or punch cards ?
Because it &apos;s not like the money .
And that shows that it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s clear , the more specific it becomes a tool for helping people save more .
So the lesson I did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and we did a paper with people in <unk> who worked at <unk> and now those who were in a phase of a 401 plan , and they could teach the plan to work for the <unk> <unk>
And for this period we keep a phase , but just one little thing .
The small thing we added , we asked people to just indicate that the positive thing would happen in their future if they were saving more .
By doing that , by doing that , it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> to 20 percent and more people who are willing to save or make money to save up to 40 percent .
Third art : The classification .
We can solve more than we solve the alternative .
For instance , this is a very , very where we did a magazine .
It shows that <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the grocery corridors were everywhere from all from <unk> <unk> , Different magazines from <unk> .
But what do you know about ?
If I show you 600 of the magazines , I split it into 10 variations of me as I just showed you 400 journals and split it into 20 variations , and you believe that I &apos;ve given you a lot of choices and choices that are better than me .
Because the division tell me how to split them .
Now , two different women are different .
One thing is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other thing is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
If you think the side of the left is <unk> and the right is a lot of <unk> .
Good , some people .
If you think on the left , <unk> and the right is <unk> , please invite you clapping .
Well , more than a little bit .
Now , it shows you that you &apos;re right .
Inside the left is a lot of <unk> and on the right , and you know what it doesn &apos;t .
This is a very useless arrangement .
The division must be said to be something to people who are not making a choice .
And you often see that the problem when it reduces it down is the list of all the major resources .
Who are the person who looks at information ?
I was the fourth designer .
It shows that we can actually solve a lot more information than we can do , we can make them easier .
We have to get into the complexity .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Think about an extreme choice : Buy one car .
This is German trucks for you , and you have a chance to customize your car .
You have over 60 different decisions , to finish your shoes .
And those options are going to change a number of choices that they give each decision .
The color , the outside color , I had <unk> 56 <unk> .
The engine , to <unk> have four options .
So what I &apos;m going to do is I will change the line that those decisions exist .
So half the clients go from a lot of <unk> , 56 cars , to four choices , four engines to reach .
And half the other half the world , from the lower choice , four engines to come to the greater greater choices , 56 colors .
What do I mean ?
You &apos;re busy .
If you just pressed the button , &quot; A decision that makes sure that you &apos;re too much more choices , that means you lose me .
What you find is that people go from the choices that are less low than the pressing button and continue for again .
We &apos;re losing them .
They go from the low choice , they &apos;re stuck there .
With the source information , the number of options .
The only thing I &apos;ve done is I &apos;ve changed the line that information is shown in that .
If I start with you , I learn how to choose .
Even choosing the engine to the numbers , no longer I think of any interest in the involvement of the interior , it still enables me to know how to make a choice .
It also gave me the great interest of this big product that I stuck with it , so I was so excited to be driven and I was busy .
Let me summarize .
I talked about four strategies to solve the challenges that are <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in fact , in addition to the other . In fact , it &apos;s more practical . How to make it more realistic . How to do it ?
All of the tricks I &apos;m showing you today is designed to help you control your choices better , and you can apply yourself to your friend service .
Because I believe that the key to choosing the best from that choice is to be more technical .
And the more we can add more and more more closely in the choices we can better in art practice .
Thank you very much .
I think we have to do something about &quot; traditional &quot; in medicine .
And I think that &apos;s starting to start with a physician , and that &apos;s me .
And maybe I &apos;ve been doing a long time to leave a little bit of credit that I &apos;m not supposed to do that .
Before I really started the part of the talk , let &apos;s start with the baseball flag .
Oh , why not ?
We &apos;re going to be going to be the destination , and we &apos;re going to go to the world .
Who doesn &apos;t love baseball , there &apos;s no ?
The baseball bubble filled the incredible statistics .
And there are hundreds of these numbers .
The book &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be released , and basically it &apos;s about statistics and use data to build a great baseball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on a number that I hope to be so sure about .
It &apos;s just the number of hits .
So for example , the 300 meters , a <unk> player .
So , the next 10 times the ball hits a battery , and it puts a full ball of safety .
That means the shade hits the area , it falls down , it &apos;s not catching , and the mate wants to throw it back to the one , and the safe runner .
You can &apos;t hear 10 times .
Do you know a player with a number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called what &apos;s called what &apos;s called ?
Good , great , maybe <unk> .
Do you know what people call a <unk> with the 400 ?
By the way , it &apos;s a <unk> player , ten times a ten times safe .
<unk> -- the big myth is that Ted Williams -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at the end of the last 400 years .
So , let &apos;s take this story into my medical world , a more <unk> subject to me , and maybe even more pleasant than a little bit of what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
Suppose you have <unk> and you get to a surgeon with <unk> surgery is 400 .
It &apos;s okay that this isn &apos;t okay , right ?
Well , Aristotle is in a remote area , and you have a <unk> of <unk> and family <unk> who have the <unk> <unk> who has a license on the <unk> of <unk> .
But , but do you know what ?
The other year on the hand in my hand , and the job of the job . She &apos;s got a series of success .
And that &apos;s only the number of <unk> .
It &apos;s okay .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
You think of the <unk> of a bypass surgeon , a nurse or a orthopedic surgeon , a <unk> doctor , a <unk> doctor ?
1000 , great .
But actually nobody knows in the medical whole department , or a good surgeon , or a doctor who needs to need &quot; ball . &quot;
So what we do is push them , tell me that I &apos;m in the world with the commandments and the commandments .
Never , absolute <unk> , but you worry about the details , how to do it not to commit to screw .
And that &apos;s the message I &apos;m <unk> when I learned the medical school .
I &apos;m a student obsessed with perfection .
In the popular school , you all have me to say that , Brian <unk> has a little bit of a bite .
And so I tried perfect .
I learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the hospital community in the hospital hospital , and there was nowhere near this .
And I &apos;m in <unk> everything .
I learned in the anatomic class , and the activity of every <unk> , branches of <unk> <unk> from the aorta , the complex diseases , both rare and popular .
I know all the different kinds of trials as the <unk> strain of <unk> .
And for the process , I collect more knowledge .
I &apos;m good , I &apos;m good for the best , the privilege .
And I graduated from the medical press to press impression that I remember and knew , the more and more , the more likely &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; s &apos; &apos; s , &quot; the &quot; prefer &quot; to be free .
And the theory seemed to be a while until I met her .
I &apos;m doing a live hospital in a medical hospital in Toronto when she <unk> &apos;s <unk> in the hospital hospital where I work .
I was given the pilot &apos;s <unk> in open-heart surgery .
And my mission to the office office , and the hospital would ask the heart , to explore the emergency room .
And reporting came back to the <unk> .
And I met her , she was <unk> .
And when I heard her , she made her voice .
And when I heard her chest <unk> , I can hear the tone that separates the <unk> on both sides of the road .
This is happening when the hearts &apos;t normally do normal , and instead of grasping blood , some blood movements will touch your lungs , and then blood fill your lungs , and so resilient patients breathe .
This diagnosis is not hard .
I was a diagnosis and started for her .
I gave her her <unk> . I picked the drug to reduce my heart .
I gave a drug to her to pee from <unk> .
And for a half a second , two hours later , she started to see more <unk> .
And I also see it .
And that &apos;s the first time , I &apos;m going to get her .
Actually , I made two more mistakes .
I gave her the hospital without speaking before the surveillance doctor .
I won &apos;t call my phone and work that I should have to do , call the doctor &apos;s therapist and do it all for him to get an opportunity to meet the patient .
And he knew the patient , you would probably add to her .
Maybe I have the right reason .
Maybe I don &apos;t want to do a serious <unk> .
Maybe I &apos;d like to be successful and <unk> and <unk> that I made a job and caring for the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s way to guide him .
My second mistake was worse .
When she got to the hospital , I struck a little voice in my lap trying to tell me , &quot; Goldman Sachs , not a good idea . &quot;
In fact , I lack to the question , I asked the nurse who is taking care of her <unk> , &quot; Do you think to her to be okay ? &quot;
And the nurse thinks once and she &apos;s saying , &quot; Oh , I think she would be okay . &quot;
I remember all of this as yesterday .
So I signed up the hospital , and the ambulance arrives , and the medical sent her home .
And I went back to the work in my clinic .
The rest day , that height , I had <unk> .
But I still do work .
By the day , I cleaned up the hospital and went to the bank and went to the bank , and he got the steering car , and I did a job where I didn &apos;t .
I went through the E.R. on the <unk> .
And there , another nurse , not nurses care at before , but another nurse , said to me three letters that I knew that the two were awesome .
Who made it all awesome , he said , but the emergency medicine is even more important because we met the <unk> patient .
These three letters are imitation ?
&quot; Do you remember your patient for the Academy ? &quot;
The nurse asked simple .
&quot; Oh , she went back and said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s true .
Oh , you have to go back .
She came back and reached the death .
About a hour after she &apos;s home , after I gave her home , she said , her father and her family called <unk> and his family would <unk> her back to the emergency room and her blood pressure were 50 , in the very <unk> threshold .
And she was almost <unk> and broccoli .
And the emergency agent uses all kinds of people .
They gave her their <unk> .
They put her in the air .
And I was shocked to <unk> my bones .
And I like to sit in the <unk> , because after you go to stabilize <unk> , she &apos;s taken into the <unk> care package , and I hope <unk> <unk> is the grandmother .
And in two or three days later , every single comment is that she never woke up .
Her brain was <unk> to be able to change .
And the family came together .
And in the course of eight or nine days next , they surrender .
And after about nine days , they leave her -- she <unk> , his mother , and the grandmother .
They said no .
And that &apos;s the first time I know about that .
In the next few weeks , I plunged myself and I first experienced that shame that was inadequate in our medical culture -- in that culture I saw her alone , separated , no shame , because I can &apos;t tell my peers .
You know that shame , when you leave a secret , is that your best friend gets to swear and then you &apos;re <unk> and you &apos;re the best of your friends and you have a very virgin repertoire , but you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And you <unk> the damage and never <unk> .
This kind of shame is a <unk> .
The shame is that I &apos;m speaking about the kind of making you <unk> your <unk> .
It says , not what you do is not be bad , but you &apos;re a bad person .
And that &apos;s what I feel .
And not because my <unk> <unk> ; he &apos;s <unk> .
He talked to the patient , and I &apos;m pretty sure he <unk> everything and ensuring that I wasn &apos;t sued .
And I kept asking myself .
Why don &apos;t I ask the doctor to appeal ? Why is it for patients ?
And in the most excruciating moments : Why is stupid mistakes so stupid ?
Why do I learn medical ?
But , unfortunately , feeling very mild .
I started to see a little bit better .
And in a matter of clouds , there &apos;s wings between clouds and the sun , and I &apos;m wondering , I &apos;m probably so much better than again .
And I dress up with myself that I &apos;m trying to fold to be perfect and never <unk> anymore , please let the <unk> end .
And that voice stops .
And I went back to work .
And that happened .
Two years later I was the official doctor in the <unk> department in a community hospital Toronto , and I discovered a young man who was <unk> <unk> .
Now , busy , I &apos;m a bit <unk> .
He just pointed to it .
I watched his throat , it &apos;s a little pink pink .
And I assigned her <unk> and for him .
And even though he was walking out of the door , he was just just about his neck .
And two days after I went to the next 20 million recovery row , and that &apos;s my time to ask my own talk to me in her .
And she said , &quot; Remember , remember ?
&quot; Do you remember your patient <unk> ? &quot;
Well , it turns out , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
He got an risk to be able to risk a risk of <unk> .
You can burrow down this disease on Google , but it &apos;s disease , not <unk> , but the upper part of the gas , and it can lead to the air .
And luckily , he was dead .
You have to vaccinate and <unk> after a few days .
And I went through a <unk> , and I felt like , I felt , and I was going to work back , and then it was going to go back , and then again , again .
Two times in a <unk> , I don &apos;t have a <unk> infection .
Now , the mistake is not the easiest is that when you &apos;re in a hospital that is at the time that you &apos;re in a hospital .
In both cases , I &apos;m not giving the patient to the hospital and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to take care of .
There &apos;s a patient who I think is <unk> .
I asked my kidney to photograph the kidney . When I saw my normal kidney , my colleagues were undergoing the <unk> of the <unk> to the right pain , and he called the surgeon .
The patient was <unk> .
I asked the country to get to help , and I would have to get him to get to him .
And my colleagues were exploring and when he discovered the <unk> of the <unk> to pain , and he called the surgeon .
In both cases , patients were all influenced by <unk> and <unk> .
But every time they were <unk> me , I devoured .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that my worst mistakes just show in the first year of my career as many of my colleagues said , all of the trash .
Some of my mistakes happen in the last year .
Mrs. Alisch , tiger , no help .
The problem is that , if I can &apos;t tell you about my flaws , if I &apos;m going to lost a little voice of that little child &apos;s voice , how to tell me what really happened , how do I share my
How do I teach them to be me to do that , and they &apos;re not going to go into the car ?
If I go to a room -- like this , I &apos;m totally not sure what you might think about me .
When you &apos;re at the end of your eye , someone &apos;s talking about a mistake , and wrong , wrong ?
Well , you go to a fancy dinner party and maybe you heard about a <unk> guy , but you wouldn &apos;t hear someone else &apos;s mistake .
If I had to go into a room filled with my colleagues and I asked them to help , and start telling you , maybe I &apos;m not going to be the first two years before they &apos;re irrational , and they &apos;ll be going to be able to
And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues also knew that my colleagues saw the <unk> of patient illness , in my hospital hospital , I believe , I &apos;m going to see the <unk> .
That &apos;s the system we have .
A completely wrong battle .
It &apos;s a system in which there are two positions -- mistakes and <unk> and <unk> who are not <unk> , and the people who are <unk> , and people who have <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s almost like an internal response , as if it &apos;s <unk> to attack .
And we have this idea that if we &apos;re <unk> the <unk> out of the medical system , the rest is just a safe system .
But there are two problems with that .
So for about 20 years I wrote a paper and made my own <unk> , and I studied the raw and wrong medicine in medicine to learn everything that could , from one of the first few years I wrote to the Harry Lawrence shows to my television show .
And what I learned is that there is a mistake .
We work in a system that has a mistake , which has a way wrong , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a good idea or a drug addict or a dose , in which the vaccine infections are more likely to be <unk> .
In this country , to <unk> people in the world , from the wrong way of avoiding .
In the United States , the Institute of Medicine asked the <unk> .
In both cases , this is all the <unk> estimates that , because we &apos;ve never been careful this problem , we &apos;ve never been to a problem .
And the problem is that this .
In a hospital system where medical knowledge has doubled , or three years , we can &apos;t keep traveling .
<unk> <unk> .
We can &apos;t even get rid of this .
We have stereotypes based on the experience of availability , for example , I can accept that a patient &apos;s disease has a very good burden of bone .
Now the patient &apos;s patient , he says he &apos;s wet and he &apos;s <unk> and <unk> into his breath , and suddenly the money of my disease has been <unk> .
I don &apos;t apply to the same money .
I &apos;m not robots ; I &apos;m not a single one .
And my patient doesn &apos;t have to attack ; no time they all do it in the same way .
With those things , mistakes are inevitable .
So , if you &apos;re <unk> the system , as I &apos;ve been told , and eliminating all the <unk> of the <unk> industry , no one left up .
And you know what people don &apos;t want to talk about are their worst situations ?
So in my television &apos;s orbit , &quot; The <unk> <unk> , the Dark Art , &quot; the Dark Art , &quot; This is my worst mistake , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell everyone from the healthcare worker to the heart of heart attack , &quot; This is the worst black mistake . &quot;
And they would also be <unk> , they would <unk> , they would <unk> , and they would look down and swallowed them and swallow it and start telling me their story .
They want to tell their story . They want to share their story .
They want to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t go to my car . &quot;
What they need is a <unk> environment .
What they need is a medical culture need to redefine .
And this starts from every physician .
The doctor , according to the notion of <unk> , is that human bone equals meat , who knows you &apos;re just a human being , who is not proud of it , but trying to learn something from that .
She shares that experience with others .
You &apos;re very supportive when others are talking about their mistakes .
And you just make the distinction of other people &apos;s mistakes not , &quot; It &apos;s not going to be &quot; that will be &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is a way to support people who can be better .
And you do work in medicine accepting that the system is controlled by human beings , and when people control the system , they will have a mistake .
So the system is evolving to create a project that &apos;s going to be a <unk> to detect a more simple mistake than the mistakes that people can &apos;t get and create , in a way , Republicans , and especially people like me .
My name is Brian Farmer .
I &apos;m a new medical doctor .
I &apos;m human . I &apos;m wrong .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I try to learn something that I can just give to others .
I still don &apos;t know what you think about me , but I can get that .
And let me end with my three words : I remember .
Hi everyone . I &apos;m Kevin <unk> . <unk> is the dominant superintendent of YouTube , and I watch videos on YouTube .
Really .
Today we &apos;re going to spend a little time talking about how video video gets to be popular and next is why this is remarkable .
We all want to be celebrities , theater , comedian and when I &apos;m young , it seems very hard to do .
But now , video on the web has done that to anyone in any of us or any creative product that we make all the most famous in the world of the world .
Anyone in your body can be famous online in Saturday .
But there &apos;s over 48 hours to YouTube every single minute .
And in that number , there &apos;s only a little <unk> rate , getting more views , and becoming a cultural phenomenon .
So how does this happen ?
Three reasons : the people who made a movement , the community involved and unexpected .
We start .
Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh my God !
<unk> !
<unk> ! <unk> !
Last year , Rainforest <unk> posted this video he shot his way out of his house in Yosemite National Park .
In 2010 , video has 23 million views .
This is the graph of that , when this video was the first time that the first time became popular in the summer .
But the H doesn &apos;t try to create a video .
He just wanted to see the rainbow .
Because that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re the <unk> Green dolphin , the <unk> of the <unk> .
He actually posted a lot of video .
While this video is posted to one month .
So what happens here ?
In fact , Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy <unk> posted this on <unk> to finally get this video to be popular now .
Because the people who created such a movement like Jimmy <unk> shows us something new and interesting things like to do that to a larger audience .
Number 6 , six . <unk> the front of the <unk> , everyone is waiting for the weekend , the weekend . First , Friday . <unk> the front of the New shower -- You don &apos;t think that we have this talk today .
Rebecca &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular news videos .
For 200 million views .
This is the diagram of that .
And the same , like &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; seems like it just up from the air .
So what happens to this day ?
Well , it &apos;s a sixth day .
And if you &apos;re wondering about the other peaks , they also go on Friday nights .
What about this day ? At the sixth moment ?
Well , <unk> saw , and the online dating date started writing about it .
Michael <unk> Nelson &apos;s <unk> from the unknown Society is one of the first people posted a joke on this online web .
But that &apos;s the point , and a group of groups are a <unk> of <unk> and they share a view and they share with more audiences , helping <unk> dramatically .
And then after this community was created from people who knew that this joke and they started saying , and doing some things .
The result is now over 10,000 copies of &quot; <unk> &quot; on YouTube .
Even in seven days , in every day , there was a video jam .
Unlike the entertainment of the 20th century , participation in this community is how we become part of the phenomenon of spreading or doing something new with it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is a cartoon image of repeated music .
It just goes like this .
This video has been nearly 50 million views in this year .
And if you think that &apos;s odd , you should know that there is an hour of it that &apos;s four million views .
Even cats are watching this video .
The kittens are watching the other cats watching this video .
But the key thing is that the creativity that transmits it to this strange Internet culture .
There are all the <unk> .
Somebody made an old version of it .
And then it brought the international economy .
A <unk> community moves it into a fool &apos;s game , something that we can be part of .
Because now we don &apos;t just enjoy it , but we &apos;re involved .
And who can predict anything about this ?
Who can predict &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or Rebecca Black &apos;s star or &quot; Stop <unk> . &quot;
What can you write this scene in ?
In a world that the video has more than two days goes to every single minute , just one unique thing and suddenly that might be able to attend to the way that these things have .
When my friend told me that I needed to see this amazing video of a person who <unk> the bike ticket in New York City , I had to admit to me not very exciting .
So , the video &apos;s film is that I accept tickets because I haven &apos;t been riding a bicycle in the bike lane , but there are <unk> that make you not going to the bike bike .
Completely amazing and funny , Casey <unk> took the idea of his great idea and his opinion for five million views .
And so this approach is still good for anything new than we do a creative way .
And so it gives us a big question .
The Laptop Cloud &apos;s video : What does this mean ?
<unk> .
What does that mean ?
These people who make a movement , the tribal communities , the things that are all <unk> , are the characteristics of a kind of media and new culture where anyone can access and the audience to decide the universality .
I mean , as I mentioned before , one of the biggest stars in the world today , Justin Bieber , starts with YouTube .
Nobody has to let your idea .
And we all feel a couple of assets in our own pop culture .
And these are not the defining characteristics of the media , but as virtually not the media of today &apos;s media , but they will decide how to resolve the future .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about none of the unexpected findings .
Now I work in solar industry .
And the new company of mine is trying to <unk> into the environment by paying attention .
... <unk> to contribute to the community .
This is a short video showing what we &apos;re doing .
<unk> . Wait for a little .
Maybe it takes a second to run a video .
We &apos;ll just -- we can just ignore -- I &apos;ll leave this .
No .
This is not ...
All right .
Technology is ...
Oh , what am I going on ?
All right . Thank you very much .
My story begins right here , in Rajasthan , about two years ago .
I was in the desert , and I was in the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> Ali .
We talked to it as a time without having to change from ancient Indian usage .
At the time , when people were in the acknowledged , we would dance to a horse ride and <unk> through the sky .
Today , we also do the same with the airplane .
At the time , when the <unk> , the great Indian warrior , when his <unk> , he would give his money , he would give his name , he would <unk> his way to the ground and the water would <unk> .
Today , we also do drill and machine .
The conclusion we learned is that the magic &apos; s &apos; is replaced with machines .
And this made me feel sorry .
I felt like I became a <unk> .
I feared that I would be going to take interest and <unk> to kiss that without <unk> -- without texting , but not by giving you a way to my friends .
And apparently the new technology has to create magic , not killing it .
When I was a little girl , he gave me a <unk> .
And the 50 years of technology became the most beautiful object for me .
It became the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> world , and he got to <unk> and <unk> and images of my imaginations .
So I felt like our mobile phones , the happy clocks and our camera and our camera .
They are <unk> their creative inspiration .
And so I jumped in , jumping into this technology community , to see me can use it to create magic , not eliminating it .
I &apos;ve been writing books since I was 16 .
And so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling tool that was able to connect readers throughout the world .
It knows how we &apos;re holding it .
It knows where we are .
It connects images , letters , visualization , visual , and feel touch .
The storytelling story is becoming more and more intuitive .
But what are we doing with it ?
So I &apos;m going to be going to go to and start <unk> , and I &apos;m going to play a interactive software .
Here we tell you , &quot; Give you your hand every single lamp . &quot;
And so -- it said , &quot; This Book of music is ... &quot; And so I typed my name into .
And in fact , I turned into a character in the book .
At some point , a little letter fell to me -- and the iPad knows where you &apos;re in , because the GPS &apos;s film gets to my address .
I &apos;m so interested in the possibilities of this .
Now , I said a lot about the magic .
And I mean , I &apos;m not <unk> or <unk> , I mean , the magic magic , the idea we all cherish when it &apos;s a young .
The <unk> idea in the glass glass , no idea why , always as exciting as I am .
And so here , you need the <unk> , to get fireflies .
And they &apos;ll show you the rest of the book .
Another idea of <unk> I was a <unk> , and I was a huge <unk> of <unk> .
And so here , every book and every world comes into a little ball that I drag in this instrument in a different device .
And a open map .
At the same time , what the Old Testament is also the same map , but these maps are static .
This is a giant <unk> map , and it flashes and it <unk> you for the rest of the book .
So at the point of the book , it will show you the secret .
So I &apos;m going to go to the right now .
The fact is that it &apos;s really important to me to create real content , but still the modern thing .
Here , here are the <unk> .
We all heard about the teachers , we all heard about the <unk> , but who are not in India that they know about the Indian version , the <unk> ?
These <unk> <unk> were locked in <unk> &apos;s offices for thousands of years in a very mild <unk> book .
And so we bring them back to a modern book .
And one story is also the kind of <unk> problem .
By the way , I think about environmental issues , I think a big problem in the last 10 years is that children have been locked in the room , glued to the computer screen , they didn &apos;t appear to play .
But now with mobile technology , we can bring little kids out , in the natural world .
One of the interactions in the book is you &apos;re sent to a search tour of it , and you have to go out to use the image of the iPad and take a picture of different natural objects .
When I was a kid , I had a series of collections , rock , gravel and possessed .
And so , this day kids are not gathering anymore .
So , in the way , in the sense of the younger , you have to go out , and , in a chapter , take a picture of a flower and record it .
In another another , you have to take a picture of a <unk> shell and note it .
And what happens is you create a digital collection that you can show up online .
A little girl showed a picture and said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m seeing the needle . &quot;
The Indian baby says , &quot; I &apos;m seeing the monkey . &quot;
And that creates a kind of social media around the digital collection that you get .
In the ability to connect , the Earth and technology , and so many other possibilities are different .
In the next book , we plan to have an interaction that you draw to the <unk> of the video and through the current technology , you see this kind of dynamic <unk> that shows you this <unk> .
At a time , your screen is full of <unk> .
And so you have to create the wind and blow the leaf back and read the rest of the list .
We are moving forward , all we &apos;re moving to a world where natural power to almost <unk> technology , and magic and technology can be closer together .
We &apos;re mining solar .
We are taking our children and we are closer to the natural world and the magic and joy and joy and love us through simply one story .
Thank you .
Because I &apos;m usually the people who try to explain to people who understand new technologies coming out of the world , and I think , because I &apos;ve been in all of you , I &apos;ll tell you what your <unk> is going to be , and you know how to do it , and you know , to know what it &apos;s going to be .
I &apos;m going to start with just giving a paper paper report .
Next , if you can turn to this report .
This is just a random newspaper , but I picked from my documents .
What I &apos;d like to show people is not the details of the op-ed page , but the general model .
This is a report on the analysis of our analysis that we &apos;re doing in the comparison between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the overall network .
And the interesting thing is that this report , like a lot of popular papers of various technology reports with us , is a kind of straight approach on a <unk> .
In other words , each country in the audience represents a level of performance .
And this is a new thing we refer to as the <unk> curve .
There &apos;s something that is weird .
And that basically is what I mean .
Now , if you can make a higher light .
If you can make a higher light , because I need a piece of paper here .
Why should we draw the technical curves in the <unk> ?
The answer is , if I plot it on a normal curve , can tell , it &apos;s a year , and it &apos;s a kind of time , and whether this is the measure of what technology I &apos;m trying to prove , the graph looks like , it &apos;s a very silly
They seem to be spinning like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us a lot .
Now if I plot graph , for example , another technology , maybe technology , can be a vaccine , on a Creative Street Street , it looks very absurd , like a straight line .
But when this happens , everything is going to change .
So , if the delivery of the fast development were like , then the day after the computer , then I could call a taxi and go in Tokyo .
It &apos;s not like that .
And there &apos;s no money in technological history about the growth of the growth by changing a few years .
Now the question I want to ask is , if you look at the curve of the number of these <unk> , they don &apos;t count forever .
Things can &apos;t change dramatically as they are happening .
One of the two things that will happen .
Or it will be a <unk> format like this , until something different from a completely happening , or maybe , it will turn into this .
That &apos;s all possible .
Now , I &apos;m optimistic , so I think it can go in this way .
If it &apos;s true , it means that we are in the middle of the transformation .
We are on this line in the <unk> of the <unk> , which has been to the state that the world is now .
And so what I &apos;m going to ask , what I &apos;m still asking , is that , what is the new state that the world is going to exist ?
What about the world &apos;s new life ?
Because the transition is so difficult to know when we &apos;re in the middle of that process .
When I was a kid growing up , the future for me is the year 2000 , and everyone expected to be going on in 2000 .
This is a conference that everybody talks about the future , and everyone can recognize that future is still around the year 2000 .
It &apos;s remote for us to go to it .
So , in other words , the future tends to <unk> a year for every single day .
I think the reason that &apos;s the reason is because we all feel something that &apos;s going on at the moment .
That transportation is happening . We can all feel it .
And we know that it doesn &apos;t mean very much to think about 30 , 50 years after that all of this will be very different from the <unk> , which we &apos;re doing today without any meaning in that moment .
So what I &apos;m going to talk about is that , what I mean , is that , is that , the transformation is that we &apos;re experiencing .
To do that , I &apos;m going to talk about a bunch of things that don &apos;t have to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is actually putting myself into the past and spending a long long-term perspective .
<unk> , I &apos;d like to look at the time of the <unk> of life on Earth .
And so , I think this picture has its meaning if everybody looks at it with a few billion years .
If everybody comes back to the last two billion years , the Earth has been so big this , with the full songs of chemicals around it .
And if people look at the chemical <unk> , we &apos;ll start to understand what they are doing .
And I think there are some <unk> solutions that are going to be able to get the way it started with RNA , but I would tell a simple story about it , the story , at the time , there were tiny oil droplet floating in the same way that it was
And some of those droplet oil that has a special combination of <unk> in its components makes them connect with chemicals outside and do big oil droplet .
And the oil vessels started to separate and divide .
And they are the most primitive protocells , which are the tiny <unk> .
But today , the oil droplet doesn &apos;t exist , like we &apos;re talking about now , because they &apos;re random <unk> of chemicals .
And all it divides , they all divide into the chemical parts of them .
And so , all of the <unk> are different .
In fact , the different steps in the way that they make them more likely to connect with chemicals around them , growing faster , more sensitivity and divide more .
So , the <unk> tends to be more likely to be able to unfold .
It &apos;s just a basic chemical format of life , but it &apos;s more exciting things when they &apos;re in the clouds , and they &apos;re going to extract .
Somehow we don &apos;t understand , these little <unk> learn to leave .
They learn how to archive information that information is the chemical formula of cells in a particular chemical called DNA .
In other words , they form , in evolution , without awareness , a form that allowed them to write them , so they could copy .
The surprising thing is that the information storage seemingly , so it would be stable because it evolved and a half billion years ago .
In fact , our genes , the same rules , are the same and way of storing it .
In fact , every living living is all <unk> of genes &apos;s genome , the same system of <unk> and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I &apos;ve done to do is , we can now store things that are <unk> .
I have 100 <unk> of white flour , which I usually have to try to hide the guard at the airport .
But in this -- what I did , I made this code -- the code of the standard , we used to map it -- and I wrote my business card on a piece of DNA and <unk> it into 10 to 22 times .
If someone likes to get hundreds of millions of copies of my business cards , I can get people in this room so much , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I &apos;m a liberal identity , I can make it into a virus and release it into this room .
So what are the next step ?
Design creates a DNA structure .
And it creates these cells -- to do these cells , and it exists more for a billion years .
But then , there is another phase of a very interesting period , and it &apos;s also a very interesting thing to be , and that &apos;s the moment where these cells start exchanging and communicate , and the same thing is the same cell .
I don &apos;t know if you know that , but the bacteria can actually communicate the DNA .
Because , for example , antibiotics are formed .
Some bacteria find a way of antibiotic antibiotics , and it spread around their genomes with other bacteria , and today we have a lot of bacteria that are able to resist penicillin , because the bacteria communicate .
This communicates that the microbes that could enable bacteria to form that in which included the same kind of thing that they had .
And so , they &apos;re <unk> or <unk> , and that means , if a community tends to be a good community , all individuals in the community are producing more fish and they evolved in the positive direction .
So the transition time when these communities are together , in fact , they &apos;re together in the form of manufacturing for all of the colony in a single array of DNA .
And so , the next process is interesting in life spending about a billion years .
And at that time , we have vast diversity of cells , and the colony is ubiquitous , working together as a single organ .
And in fact , we are a very diverse fellow .
We have a lot of cells that they can &apos;t exist alone .
Everybody &apos;s skin is not going to work without the <unk> of the heart of heart disease , cells , brain cells and lots of other cells .
So , these communities start to evolve the interesting levels that evolved to occur without being on one cell , but on one of our fellow populations called living .
The next process is in this crowd .
These are the cell colonies , again , to extract information .
And they start to form special patterns that have no other effect except processing information in populations .
And that &apos;s the neurological structures .
<unk> neurons are the information processing mechanisms that the cell colony produces .
And in fact , they &apos;re <unk> in the colony and the microscopic structures that are responsible for notes , reading , Information processing .
And that &apos;s the brain and the nervous system of those communities .
And they bring up the <unk> process .
Because at that point , a individual -- to deal with information that can happen in a period of life , and in fact , instead of this period of evolution .
So a living organism , for example , learn nothing to eat a kind of a consequence because it has taste taste and it &apos;s hard to be in trouble .
It can happen throughout the course of a living organism , whereas when they &apos;re making this very special structure , that might be learned in evolution for hundreds of thousands of years .
The nervous system , the truth is that they form these special <unk> structures , which are very quickly pushing the evolution of evolution .
Because the evolution of today can be present within an individual .
It can happen in information processing .
But then what happens is that the individual beings form of course , and then , of course , the tricks of communication .
For example , the most complicated version we know about human language is the language of human language .
If you think about it , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a great invention .
I had a very complex thought , messy , and ambiguity in mind .
I &apos;m sitting here saying <unk> , hopefully creating people &apos;s heads , and think of <unk> and dreams and have a little bit of thinking like my thinking .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into language , a range of sounds , and form in the brain , and the more complex people think of .
It allows us to survive as a living organism .
And in fact , what we &apos;ve done is that human beings , we start to know .
We &apos;re undergoing the same process as most of the living organisms that are , in fact , are experiencing the <unk> , which is the <unk> , the processing .
For example , the invention of speech said speech is a little improvement of that dimension .
The telephone , computer , video , a CD , and so on is the kind of equipment that we create in society to work with information .
And they all connect us into a larger community , and we have a much longer evolved capacity to evolve than we &apos;ve ever seen .
So now , evolution can happen in a moment a few seconds .
People saw the little example of <unk> about evolution when he pushed evolution on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have a time going up for time .
So the first steps of my story I told people about a billion years .
And the next stage , like the nervous system and the brain , loses several hundred million years .
The next process , as language and stuff like , happens in less than a million years .
And the next process , like electricity , seems to be just a few decades .
This process continues to occur and become , I guess , to be acting from appropriate words -- when a process is <unk> .
The more changed , the speed it changed , the more it changed .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here , in the explosion of this curve .
We &apos;re seeing this process <unk> ourselves .
Now I &apos;m designing computers to make money , and I know that my device uses to design computers without using any recent technology in the computer .
So now , what I &apos;m doing is the design with complexity , which seems impossible to do if design is in traditional television .
I don &apos;t know the justice of all the transistor in the machine .
Because there are billions of transistors .
Instead , what I do as the kind of thing that the candidates are doing at the headquarters is the <unk> <unk> , then we think about the level of regenerative innovation and extract that extract into the machines and that machine using more effective drugs than we can , we can do it , and we can
And in fact , sometimes they do it by the way we don &apos;t even understand .
A particularly interesting method I &apos;m still using is the <unk> .
What we do is put into a process of development , which happens in a very small <unk> .
For example , in particular cases , we can actually grow a program by starting with the wiring .
Or another way , &quot; Computers , you can give hundreds of millions of random speakers .
Now if you can do all of those random <unk> , run all of those programs , and choose the most sociable programs that I &apos;m going to do . &quot;
In other words , I identified the thing that I wanted .
When I want to rearrange numbers , one simple example I can do .
And to find the most sociable curriculum with the full task .
And of course , the random phrase would not have to be the numbers , so no one would really do it .
But one of them , if they &apos;re lucky , will put two to the right position .
And I said , &quot; Computers , you can choose 10 percent of those random pieces of random random <unk> .
Hold them up . The next round .
And then , let &apos;s copy the <unk> of the best numbers .
And so , let &apos;s copy them with the same regeneration process as the breed . &quot;
So , you can take two programs and they will create a product by trade , and the product is inherited <unk> of the rules of the two programs .
I have a new program that &apos;s being produced by the combination of the programs that do better than a little bit .
I said to the computer , &quot; Let &apos;s repeat the process . &quot;
<unk> them once again .
Maybe it can give a couple of <unk> .
And again , again , it made it a different generation .
Everybody in the new generation is just a few .
And so , I can do the same evolution of a million years in a computer in a computer , or if in complex situations , some hours .
The end of the process , I &apos;ll have a very <unk> program with the number .
In fact , they &apos;re more effective programs than I can write .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell people how to operate .
I always try to probe them and show you how it works .
They are very ambiguous programs .
But they do work .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do it because they come from a range of hundreds of programs that have done that .
In fact , the survival of those programs depend on that work .
I used to sit in a 747 with Marvin Minsky , and he took out to the punch card and said , &quot; Look at it . Look at it .
It says , &quot; Is this drone going to have hundreds of details that are always active to give you a safe flight . &apos; &quot; It doesn &apos;t make you feel confident ? &quot;
In fact , we all know that the design process is not <unk> when it &apos;s too complex .
So we started to rely on computers to do a different process with construction design .
And it allows us to produce more complex products than design to do so much .
So we don &apos;t really understand the choice .
And so , in a corner , it &apos;s moving forward to us .
We &apos;re using those programs to create a faster computer that we can do much more quickly .
And so , it &apos;s driving itself .
This is going to be happening and so quickly that it &apos;s why I see it quite a disturbing thing .
Because all this technology has pushed itself .
We &apos;re taking off .
And we &apos;re at the moment that the same thing is like , when the cells are actually moving to a living body .
We are <unk> and we &apos;re almost impossible to understand what we &apos;re making .
We &apos;re at the moment of transformation .
But I think there is something that is trying to hang us .
I think we &apos;re going to be too noble if we &apos;re the ultimate product of evolution .
And I think all of us here is part of the next generation of <unk> -- no matter what .
The lunch is coming to close , and I think I &apos;m going to stop here , before I &apos;m kind of <unk> .
A few years ago I started a search party , and we made a lawsuit for them a year and worked for a year and worked in the environment , and they would have to hate the government .
This program is called Code for America and this <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
We selected a couple of press every single year , they would work with the government .
Instead of giving them to the Third World , we put them to the <unk> of the city .
In there , they would write great applications , working with staff .
But what they actually really do is to prove everything that can happen in the information community today .
Let &apos;s say Al .
Al was a <unk> <unk> in Boston .
It looks like looking for a date , but it &apos;s actually waiting for somebody , because he knows that he &apos;s not good at stopping fires when he &apos;s swallowed into <unk> .
How can it be possible to find help in a meaningful condition ?
Last year , we had a team in Boston to participate in the Code for America .
They were in February of snow .
They noticed that the city never dropped off the <unk> .
But one member called Erik <unk> , and a <unk> , and it &apos;s all of the people who are still <unk> to the whole steps .
So he did the job that any <unk> of the subject would be writing .
It &apos;s a little app that you can locate to get the <unk> .
You can lock it up when it rains .
Every time you do it , you have to name it , and he puts the first name that he &apos;s called Al .
If you don &apos;t do it , people can pick it up .
So there &apos;s a lot of motivation for this .
This is a little application .
Perhaps the smallest of the 21 applications and members of writing last year .
But it did something that no government did .
It spreads .
A man in the technology office of the city of Virginia knows , and he realizes he can use it , not for snow , but to inform the radio lanes .
These are the <unk> . They &apos;re <unk> , and they steal from them .
So he helped people to test the lamp .
And then in my decision using this software to help people get from the way to get the <unk> line .
Chicago launched software that allowed people to license sidewalk <unk> when the sun was snow .
Now there are nine cities on the planning of the app .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and nature , and nature .
If you know anything about the state &apos;s technology , you know that this is not normal .
It &apos;s a regular part of the software that disappeared for a few years .
Last year , we had a team of three people working in a <unk> project in Boston .
The project held parents to search for soap as well as her children .
There are people telling us that as usual , to build a piece of software that will take at least two years and spend about two million dollars .
But the numbers aren &apos;t .
Now there is a project in the U.S. regulatory system spending , which has spent the taxpayers tax <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are other projects that are different in every level of the state .
So a applications built in a few days , and then it &apos;s very quickly , and it &apos;s a shortcut path to build the system .
It shows how the government can work more effectively -- not like private companies , like many people thinking .
And even not as an industrial company , the Internet is better .
That means that , with no control , always open and produce new things .
That &apos;s really important .
But the more important that it &apos;s showing is that this way of solving a new generation of government -- not a single problem , but of action action .
It &apos;s a good news , because we will have more lively actions with technology &apos;s help .
Today there is a large community of people who help build tools necessary for us to work together .
It &apos;s not just the members of the United States for America , and hundreds of people all around the country are writing these very extraordinary , everyday applications that are in our community .
They haven &apos;t left up .
They see <unk> with the government , but they don &apos;t complain , they &apos;re going to fix it .
And these people know that we don &apos;t let you focus on it .
And that &apos;s when you remove the emotions of politics and the boundaries of <unk> and all that make us angry , the government , and its essence , in Tim &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Now there are lots of people who have been missing trust in government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I ask you to consider , because everything is changing .
Politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is .
And because the government says to <unk> from us -- remember , &quot; We are human ? &quot; -- what do we think about it is going to be going on .
When I started this program , I didn &apos;t know the government .
Like , many people , I thought the government was just just trying to get people to vote .
After two years , I learned special conclusion with local authorities , about <unk> rats .
This is the information centers and communication .
This is going to be where you &apos;re going to call <unk> from your city .
If you have the opportunity to do in the middle of the city of the city , like Scott <unk> , our members -- in fact , they all do -- you &apos;ll find people who are calling the government with a lot of people , and they &apos;re trapped in
Scott had to get this sense .
He typed &quot; <unk> &quot; to the main record .
He didn &apos;t think anything else . He started with control .
And finally , he said , &quot; Look , can you open all the doors to your house and play a lot of a real way and see what &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
And that was true . And a round of applause gave a blow .
But that &apos;s not all about the <unk> .
Boston is not just a single one .
It also has a app , a site and a smartphone app , which is called <unk> <unk> .
We didn &apos;t write this app .
This is the result of the <unk> of the city of the city in Boston .
Then one day -- this is actually a report -- there &apos;s something that happens : &quot; A <unk> rat in the trash . No idea it died .
How do we deal with it ? &quot;
But what happens to <unk> <unk> is different .
Scott talked directly .
But on <unk> <unk> , everything is all on , so that all possible .
And in this case , a neighbor sees .
In the next report , &quot; I &apos;m walking in the area , and I see a trash trash behind .
<unk> a cat ? Try to test . How to live ? Right .
<unk> , and then walk home .
Good night , the <unk> rat . &quot;
Pretty simple .
This is interesting . This is the mode of communication with life .
This is another kind of <unk> , the <unk> of the community .
But that &apos;s also an example of the government as a system .
Not really me talking about the definition of the system .
I &apos;m just talking about a human support system to help each other .
Everybody helped each other , but the government played the essential part here .
It connects them to two other people .
If necessary , the government &apos;s service can help them connect , but a neighbor is a good solution and saving more government than the government &apos;s services .
When this person lets people , our community became more powerful .
If you call the management centers , it will spend much more money .
One of the important things we need to think about is that it &apos;s not like politics .
Most people understand that , but they think that this is the first thing for the other .
That &apos;s the first place for the government and voting .
How many times how we vote a political leader -- and we usually spend a lot of energy to go find a political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to hope , and we &apos;re going to have a good idea , but we &apos;re going to
It &apos;s the same state , and the political is just a <unk> , and in the upper part of the surface .
And what &apos;s underneath us is called the bureaucratic machine .
We tell those words with contempt .
But that &apos;s the contempt thing that helps us to see what we have , and we have to pay for that stuff against us , and then we hurt ourselves .
There are people who think politics are very attractive .
If we want to do our own authorities , we have to make that system .
Because that &apos;s where the government &apos;s real business works .
We have to invest in the fabric of the government .
That &apos;s what <unk> did .
Have you seen these people ?
It &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens who wrote a detailed report to the counter request of the financial press .
It &apos;s not politics , but the bureaucratic system .
For those of you who lose trust in government , this is when we ask ourselves about a world we want to leave to our children .
You have to recognize the big challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
Will we achieve what we need to do without <unk> to the representative of us ?
We can &apos;t do that unless we have government , we need it to get more effective .
The good news is that technology is now helping to improve a lot of the governmental functions of a government that has to be really <unk> to the public bonding .
We have a big generation up with the creation of the Internet , and we know that it &apos;s not difficult to match each other , you just control the system .
Now the average age of the members of our group are 28 , envy me , I almost got older than ever .
This is the language of our voice to fight for the rights .
Their battle isn &apos;t like us who are not who we are going to be a person who &apos;s not who we are .
They can give it to any particular media and go at any time , and they &apos;re doing it .
When they &apos;re confronted with their problems , they can &apos;t care that they &apos;re not very interested in using their voices .
They used their hands .
They used their hands to write up their own application to write a better supporting the government .
These applications are helping us improve .
It can be a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and build the trash with a mouse in a second .
Sure , we can handle the <unk> , and we can do that .
But the applications like the <unk> of the <unk> that we don &apos;t just have to be consumers , and we don &apos;t just have a government &apos;s own government , and we can bring taxes and regain services .
More than that , we are citizens .
And we can &apos;t stabilize the government until we do a job .
Do I have a question of all of you here : When there &apos;s important things to do with our own connection , all of us , we &apos;re going to be a famous crowd , or what are we going to be ?
Thank you .
I want to tell you why a lot of electronics is failing .
And I really think that the most important thing is that we don &apos;t even listen to the patient anymore .
One of the things that we did at the University of <unk> is a <unk> .
Not a science of science -- she puts a cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asking a patient , and they &apos;re , &quot; What &apos;s the story ?
What can we help you ? &quot;
And we think this is one of the main problems that are in the way that all -- maybe not all -- but most of the computer health care projects fail , since we don &apos;t even listen to it .
This is my power . It &apos;s a very simple device .
It has a button in the middle to turn off .
I was at the top of every morning .
And so I &apos;m so nervous and nervous as you can see .
I fear that I &apos;m going to <unk> .
But what makes this machine simply , whenever I stand up , it sends my data through Google <unk> .
And my doctor would also get this data , and he can see the problems that are linked to me , and it &apos;s not just at the point where I need a <unk> , or something like that , but for the time it &apos;s the time .
But another thing .
Like some of you know that I have 4,000 people watching on Twitter .
So every morning I stood up to the weight , and before I stepped up , people started telling me that , &quot; I &apos;m like you &apos;re going to eat less <unk> . &quot;
But that &apos;s the most likely that it can happen because this is called pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since it &apos;s used to obesity , it can also use patients to use drugs .
On the other hand , it &apos;s also used to pull people out of the seats that together joined a few games to control a better way .
So in the next week , a device would soon be released .
It &apos;s the clock <unk> to the iPhone or something else .
And everybody would be in his blood van , and then sent the data to the doctor even to share with others for no more than 100 dollars .
And this is the point that patients can control and collect data on your health , not just to control themselves , but also can help us in care , because the challenges are the same for the health , and the things that we have to do , and
Making a simple technique and start with them to create a sense of <unk> patients in teams .
And you can &apos;t just do it with this kind of technique , but it &apos;s also the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And one of the things that we &apos;ve done , I &apos;m going to share with you a little video .
We all have the <unk> .
We even have it in our phones .
We know exactly where the ATM socket is in the city of <unk> .
Another one is that we know where the gas stations are .
And surely we can find a fast store store .
But where are the most recent <unk> equipment for this patient ?
We asked them to know and nobody knew .
Nobody knows where the <unk> is the most recent <unk> to save a human life moment .
And this is what we did , and we used to use the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We set up a computer and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see a <unk> device , please send us to know where it &apos;s going to work , because while it &apos;s in the main case , it doesn &apos;t work .
And over 10,000 <unk> in the Netherlands was found and sent back .
The next step we found for it .
And we built a applications on the iPad .
We did a <unk> app in order to strengthen the ability to be able to get these <unk> .
And whenever you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , you can see someone that you can use your iPhone , and in a few weeks to it , it can run on the phone phone for the most recent <unk> , which can be saved , and you can see
And today we &apos;re going to introduce this machine to not just -- but this product is called , but also <unk> .
And we want to start this whole thing all over the world .
We &apos;ve asked all of these colleagues around the world , and universities , to help us find , work and work as a center to integrate information on the world .
Whenever you &apos;re going to go to a holiday where you can see someone <unk> , it can be your relatives or somebody standing in front of us , you can still see the <unk> device .
Another thing we would like to do is really , and we would be able to help us with companies around the world that can help us maintain these <unk> .
These companies can be a fast shift transition or cell phone service , just to make sure that the <unk> used to be used to be used .
So let &apos;s help us do this and not just to be better and control it .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share with you the style of my photography .
Is it a photographer ?
Because , maybe this is a photographer you can &apos;t carry on a camera .
My hobby of photography has started when I had a computer camera at 15 .
It &apos;s woven with my passion , but there &apos;s a little different , because using a camera , the process is up .
And when you use a camera to take pictures , it &apos;s just over time you press a button .
So photography with me like a <unk> of the right , right , right , right .
I feel like anyone can do that .
So I want to create a difference , something in a place where you <unk> when you press .
These are the images : building the way along the way along the road .
But it has a <unk> scene .
And despite that , it stored the state .
Or , if you can , these images -- all the dark and colorful , but all of the same with the same outcomes of keeping your foot straight .
When I said my authenticity , my thoughts were the honesty .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually hold , but I always want it to be able to follow a way to be in a way like a picture .
The pictures where you will have a little bit of time to think about finding a secret .
So it &apos;s really , really , to grasp more , more than to embrace a moment .
But what is the secret that it does it ?
Is there something about a detail or about color ?
Is there something about a light ?
What do we make a hallucination ?
Sometimes the landscape creates hallucinations .
But ultimately it leads to work , how we do the world and how to recognize it on a two-dimensional surface .
It doesn &apos;t really mean , it &apos;s what we think it &apos;s true .
So I think the basics are pretty simple .
I just see it as the problem that you can take different parts of the existing world and their groups to create a reality .
Let me show you one example .
We have three objects that have perfect figures , the things that we all can relate to lives in three-dimensional space .
But in a way , they create something that looks still like three dimensions , like it exists .
But at the same time , we know that we can &apos;t .
So we <unk> the brain , because the brain is not comfortable with the factors that are in fact .
And I found that the combination of pictures had the same .
It &apos;s really just <unk> .
So what makes a picture of this image , I think , is that things that we never thought of , what &apos;s right all about us in life .
But when we combine the photos , this is a matter of really important things that actually weigh , because otherwise , it will not be so wrong .
So I want to give three basic principles to follow to achieve a result .
As you can see here , these images look like that , and there &apos;s nothing special .
But combined , they could create something like this .
So the first commandment is that the combination of images should have the same .
Secondly , combine images should have the same kind of light .
And two pictures are both satisfied the same -- taking at the same altitude and at the same kind of light .
The third principle is to make it really fake in the place where other pictures of pictures start and end by making them circuit .
Now , there can hardly be this image .
So by the way , the color of color , the contrast and the light in the boundaries between different photographs , adding the same kind of <unk> of the field , <unk> the color and the dust , we remove the edges between the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
Someone can probably think that this is just the picture of the landscape and the bottom that was made .
But this image is completely created by the images from different parts .
I think that &apos;s easier to create even even a context , because then you don &apos;t close to the idea of the head anymore .
But it really requires a lot of plans .
And there &apos;s this idea for the winter , I know I had to lose a couple months to prepare , to find different locations for the parts of the picture .
For example , fish are arrested in the journey .
The ocean is in another place .
The lower water is taken in a rock .
And , again , I even put the house up to the <unk> of the island , and it &apos;s more chemistry .
So to <unk> a real knee , I think it goes to the creation .
There is always a beginning with a sketches , a idea .
Then we &apos;re doing different pictures .
And here , the parts are <unk> .
And if you &apos;re good to take pictures , it can be great and really quite good .
All the tools are right here , and the only thing that we can do is , the only thing that we can do is , the imagination .
Thank you .
This sounds strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of concrete bricks .
The first concrete block that &apos;s produced in <unk> with very simple idea : the <unk> of cement , concrete equals the size of the <unk> .
The bricks that were quickly found to be used to be used most of the world &apos;s most built materials .
They help us build more than ourselves , our buildings , the bridges , every brick .
Perhaps the concrete tiles that are becoming <unk> by the <unk> .
After nearly 100 years , in 1947 , <unk> did this .
It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
And in short years , the <unk> bricks were located everywhere .
According to computation , more than 400 <unk> <unk> have been produced -- or 75 ads per person on Earth .
You don &apos;t need to be a engineer to build beautiful houses , shiny bridges or beautiful buildings .
<unk> did that .
<unk> took the concrete block , which creates the world , and it made it into the bricks of the imagination .
In that year , in the Bell labs , a revolution revolution , and the next generation of <unk> , the next generation of bricks .
<unk> is a plastic <unk> , which will take us from the world of the <unk> barbs on each other , and the world that all interactions come together .
Like the concrete bricks , transistor gives you a big set of electricity and more complex circuits , each bricks .
But there &apos;s a big difference : <unk> for professionals .
Personally , I &apos;m not comfortable with this , that the bricks should come in for experts , so I decided to change it .
Eight years ago , when I was in the media study , I discovered that this idea was how to get engineers to get into artists and designer .
A couple of years ago I started to develop <unk> .
Let me show you how they work .
<unk> is the electronic components with different functions .
They &apos;ve been designed to be a light , sound , motors and sensors .
And the most exciting part of them is they &apos;re linked to the magnet .
So you can &apos;t put them wrong .
These <unk> were tagged .
Green roofs are the beginning , the blue is the source , and <unk> is the head and orange .
So what you need to do is to be green with the green and so fast you can start to enter into the larger circuits .
You attach green water with the green , you can make a light vessel .
You give a switch into the middle and now you can make light .
Instead of rotating the <unk> , like this , and now you have a <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and now you &apos;ve made a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to turn this voice .
As you &apos;ve seen , not just to play a <unk> , and just show a tool .
Instead of preparing , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> lets you program a simple visual manipulation gestures .
To make the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or slower circuit , you just turn the slide to the <unk> and change the <unk> dot .
The idea behind <unk> is to see it as a kind of a library &apos;s being developed .
We want to integrate all the interactions in the world in the bricks that can be used easily .
Light , sounds , solar cells , the engine -- everything can be accessible .
We gave them a little <unk> to younger and watched them playing with <unk> .
And that &apos;s a great experience .
The best thing that is to make a little kid start to understand what &apos;s the activity of the computer firing devices around them that they &apos;re not learning in school .
So for example , sleep lights are going to work , or why the elevator elevator , or how the iPod <unk> back to the touch .
We also brought <unk> to the design schools .
So for example , we have designers that are completely not even knowing that a computer can start playing with <unk> as a tool tool .
And here you see , with <unk> , paper and bottles , <unk> did ...
A couple of weeks ago we took <unk> and gave them some <unk> designers with no experience with a <unk> , wood and paper -- and told them that &quot; What do . &quot;
This is an example of what they did , gun shooter shooter shooter .
Wait for this , this is my favorite project .
It &apos;s a shrimp made of a <unk> and it scares us .
For the people who are not engineers , <unk> has become another kind of material , electronic electronics become a new material .
And we want this material to be used to everybody .
So <unk> is the project .
You can go on the website , download the design and do them .
We want the world of the world who create , inventors and other people , because the world , where we live , the world is , of course , our .
Go ahead and start to invent .
Thank you .
In the &apos; 80s in Eastern Germany , Israel , if you had a typewriter , you would have to register it with the government .
Not so do that , you have to register a kind of a prototype prototype of that machine .
The purpose of this is to be able to know the source of that material .
If the government found the <unk> of the <unk> , they could be able to get to the person who was the subject of &quot; <unk> &quot; .
And we , in the West , cannot understand why that can be true when those methods are the enemy liberals .
We will never do that at all .
But today , in the moment of 2011 , if you have a laser printer from any open-source factory factory called age , if you have a paper print a paper paper , which is the light that you can get in the <unk> , the yellow one is the yellow .
This is happening today .
And it seems like no <unk> to &quot; <unk> &quot; to this .
This is an example of how our government is using technology to fight us , the citizens of the country .
And this is also one of the three major sources of the Internet on the current .
And to look at what &apos;s really going on in the world , we can sort of classify the <unk> activity on <unk> attacks .
There are three primary impacts .
From the cybercriminals .
So here , we have <unk> <unk> from the city of Kiev .
And the motivations of this kind of cybercrime is very simple and understandable .
Find money !
They use suicide activity to make a lot of money , lots of money .
So some of the examples of the <unk> are coming from the Internet to the people who are <unk> from an attack .
This is <unk> <unk> coming from <unk> , Estonia .
Alfred <unk> .
Stephen <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Matthew Anderson , <unk> <unk> , etc . , etc .
They find wealth from the Internet , through illegal methods like <unk> <unk> <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we do online communication programs , and we &apos;re doing the <unk> , and we can use a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
The U.S. <unk> Agency had the Swiss bank account of Sam <unk> of the Swedish bank , and in his photos with <unk> million dollars in the breaks .
<unk> is hiding ; and no one knows where he &apos;s .
And I claim that today the risk of the world is that we become the victims of the larger criminal crime in this world .
And the obvious truth is that these risks are getting worse .
In the future , most criminal cases will be available in the world .
The second cyberattacks that we see today is not until the purpose of money .
They &apos;re driven because of other things -- against government , no dissent , and sometimes just fun .
Groups like <unk> have been <unk> in the last 12 months and have become a major force in this attack .
So we have three primary attacks : the criminals with the money of the money -- like <unk> activity to resist and ultimately our government , the government is attacking us .
There are lots of situations like what happened in <unk> .
This is a very typical example of what happens when the government strikes themselves against their own citizens .
<unk> is a real <unk> company from the Netherlands -- or at least that it was so .
They had to submit to the bomb for last year , because their online system was destroyed .
Somebody has been coming into the system and destroying it completely .
In a last week , in a <unk> of the Dutch government , I asked a question to their leaders that if he had a sense of <unk> if he had to die , if he was attacked .
And &quot; <unk> &quot; is his answer .
How do this attack someone who can get someone online ?
<unk> is a company called the actual service provider .
They sell them to sell them .
What do you do with those things ?
In fact , you need to have such a real reality if you have a website using a protocol of <unk> , which is the <unk> service , which is the kind of translation that <unk> is using .
We all , at least most of us are using <unk> or an email app , and these services are specifically popular in the authoritarian countries like Iran , where the pundits will use the services that they &apos;re <unk> .
But everything else is going to be different , if governments can attack the certified units .
And creating hypothetical recognition .
And that &apos;s exactly what happened to <unk> .
So the Arab Spring and the Arab Spring is what happened in Egypt ?
In Egypt , when the rebel rebels closed the <unk> of the Egyptian police location in January 2011 , they discovered a lot of secret documents .
In that , there &apos;s a document that &apos;s tagged . &quot;
In this document is the notes from a company that has in Germany sold to the Egyptian government so much of the technology that can be able to listen to a big scale , and the people &apos;s population .
They sold these tools to Egypt &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
This is the main headquarters .
So the West is providing the government of financial government to fight their citizens .
But the West also did that in his country .
For example , in Germany , a few weeks ago , people were discovered <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> worker who uses to investigate their citizens .
If you &apos;re suspected <unk> <unk> <unk> , then it &apos;s a <unk> of your phones .
But it doesn &apos;t just stop there .
They &apos;re <unk> your Internet .
They &apos;re even going to use such tools like <unk> <unk> to infect your computer , and they can get all sorts of facts you exchange , you can get all kinds of conversations through your lifetime , and you can get your password .
But there &apos;s a person who looks at this issue going to respond to as soon as &quot; Okay , so it &apos;s not true , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because I &apos;m a mirror citizen citizen . &quot;
So why should I worry ?
I was completely not going to hide the silence .
But this argument is not rational .
<unk> must be made .
<unk> doesn &apos;t need to argue .
This is not the problem between privacy and security .
This is a problem between free and control .
And while we still believe in the government right now , right now , in 2011 , it &apos;s all the right for us to lose because of the better stuff .
And then we have the idea of , blindly <unk> the future , a government that we can have in 50 years ?
That &apos;s the question that we &apos;re going to worry about in 50 years .
